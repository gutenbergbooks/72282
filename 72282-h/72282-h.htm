<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the general Preface to this work, printed in the
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71536/71536-h/71536-h.htm#Page_v">first volume</a>, I pointed out that an account of the production
and distribution of books for the two centuries
immediately succeeding the invention of printing, must,
of necessity, be chiefly devoted to the operations of the
printer-publishers of the period. During these centuries
were produced a number of the great books of the world’s
literature, but it was not possible, under the existing
conditions, for the authors of these books to influence
materially the relations of literature to the State or to the
Church. Freedom of speech and even freedom of thought
depended very largely upon an untrammelled printing-press,
but the authors were able to give but little aid in
the arduous task of securing from the political and ecclesiastical
authorities the right to multiply books. It is
true that the writers of the Reformation period were in a
position to render very important coöperation in the work
of developing a reading public and in the further work of
creating machinery by means of which such public could
be reached. But notwithstanding the noteworthy exception
presented by the writings from Wittenberg and
Geneva, it remains the fact that for the centuries in question,
the works of contemporary authors constituted but
an inconsiderable proportion of the books published.</p>

<p>The lists of these earlier publishers were devoted to
editions of the complete Bible, and of the different groups
of the Biblical books, editions of the Greek and Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span>
classics and of the works of the Church Fathers, and
issues of certain philosophical treatises which also were
largely the work of writers of an earlier generation. To
these were added certain treatises on jurisprudence which
came to be accepted as authorities in the universities, together
with the various series of text-books adopted for
college and for school work. With the above were occasionally
associated books by contemporary writers, many
of which became of continued importance. These formed,
however, as said, but a very small group as compared with
the long series of reissues of accepted classics, and it was
by the latter that what might be called the literary conditions
of the time were in the main determined. With
the Reformation came an enormous increase in the production
of works by living writers. The controversies of the
period kept the printing-offices busy with the preparation
of books and pamphlets devoted to present issues, and the
great output of current controversial literature affected in
several ways the conditions and the methods of publishing.
Up to this time the books that had been published were
nearly exclusively in the form of folios, quartos, or large
octavos. With an occasional exception, such as that of
the Aldine classics, the publishers and their scholarly customers
appear to have taken the ground that if a work
was entitled to the honour of being put into print, it was
worthy of the most dignified form that the presses were
capable of producing; and, as was shown, later, in the
criticisms of correspondents of the Elzevirs and in other
expressions, there was a strong feeling among scholarly
readers that the printing of a work of literature in a sixteenmo
or twelvemo volume, showed a lack of respect for
the author, for his public, and for literature itself.</p>

<p>This prejudice in favour of portly volumes was very
largely modified, although by no means entirely overcome,
by the publications of the Reformation. The
intense interest in the theological issues and the revival of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>
religious fervour, brought into existence a new reading
public. The buying of books was no longer confined to
princes and scholars;—the masses of the people wanted to
have in their hands the writings of the Reformers or the
replies of the defenders of the Roman Church, and to an
extent which is still cause for wonderment, a very large
proportion of the common people were able to read and
were eager to read the long series of argumentative essays
many of which were devoted to themes and discussions
that could be described as scholastic, and that the average
citizen of to-day would certainly consider hard reading.
To meet the requirements of this new reading public,
requirements which called for material of small cost and
in a form convenient for distribution, the pamphlet came
into existence, and this was followed by the <i>Flugschriften</i>,
or fly-leaf literature, comprising papers or tracts of
such brief compass that they could be printed in four or
even in two pages. These <i>Flugschriften</i> were carried in the
packs of pedlars into the market-places of towns and villages
and from farmhouse to farmhouse, and they secured
a wide distribution even in territories in which their
circulation was strictly prohibited under the severest of
penalties. Some description of this feature of the literary
work of the Reformation is given in the chapter on
Luther.</p>

<p>While one result of the literary activity of the Reformation
was to popularise the work of the printing-press, another
was an immediate development of the censorship of
the Press, both heretical and ecclesiastical. The contention
that the productions of the printers must be subjected
to the approval of the authorities of the State was
made promptly after the printing-press began its work.
It was, however, only when the Press came to be utilised
as the most effective ally of the heretical reformers, that
the Church found it necessary to put into force its ecclesiastical
censorship, and that the never-ending task began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
of advertising through the various <i>Indices Expurgatorii</i>
the titles of the long series of wicked or dangerous books
which the faithful believers were warned not to read, and
which brought very serious perils indeed upon the faithless
heretics who persisted in writing, printing, selling, or
possessing them.</p>

<p>The responsibility for the selection of the books to be
printed, with the exception of the controversial writings
of the Reformation period, rested with the publishers of
the time, and the direction of the literary interests of the
book-reading public (still, of course, a very small fraction
of the community) must have been not a little influenced
by the decisions arrived at by these publishers. I conclude,
therefore, that the publishers of this period must
have exerted a larger measure of influence over the direction
of scholarly investigation and in the shaping of the
literary opinions of their age, than has been possible for
publishers in the subsequent centuries after the production
of books had been enormously increased, and when
all classes of the community had become readers.</p>

<p>In these later times the direction of the literary interests
of the diverse circles of the reading public came naturally
into the hands of the contemporary writers. While the
reissue of the accepted classics of previous generations
remained (and must always remain) an important division
of the business of publishing, an ever increasing proportion
of the work of the publishers came to be given to the
comparatively routine work of distributing among readers
the literature of the day, in the production of which literature
the authors have, in part, led and directed, and, in
part, simply followed and supplied the tastes and the
demands of their readers.</p>

<p>The fact that the position and the personal influence of
the earlier publishers were so exceptional in their character
and importance is my excuse for presenting with some
detail the record of the work of a few individuals and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
families selected as fairly representative of the class. It
seemed to me necessary in so doing, even at the risk of
adding to the dryness of the narrative, to include in the
record lists of titles (selected from the catalogues) of the
more important of the books issued by such representative
publishers. These titles give in convenient form for
reference, material from which can be secured not only an
interesting indication of the personal interests and capacities
of the publishers themselves but an impression of the
literary tastes, requirements, and possibilities of the times
and of the several communities in which the work of these
publishers was done.</p>

<p>I judge that a work of this special character will be
utilised rather for reference than for consecutive reading,
and with this understanding, it has seemed to me desirable
to make as complete as possible the record, presented
in each section, of the subject matter considered in such
section, even although such a method has rendered necessary
an occasional repetition of statements of fact or of
conclusions.</p>

Germany, a man dexterous in the engraving of stamps
and of letters, had brought to light, by means of such
characters, the invention of <i>printing</i>, and, curious concerning
such valuable knowledge (<i>bel trésor</i>), the King had
ordered the masters of the mint to select persons skilled
in the engraver’s art and to dispatch them to Mayence
that they may inform themselves of the said invention.
Under this mandate, Nicholas Jenson, an expert engraver,
was sent to Mayence, where he did acquire the art as he
had been instructed to do. But before his return to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Paris, the King had died, and Jenson, understanding that
the new monarch was not likely to be interested in the
undertaking, carried his knowledge to Venice, and was
the means (as we have seen in a previous chapter) of
securing for this city an early prestige for artistic typography
and for scholarly publishing.</p>

<p>The King who had planned to bring the printing-press
to Paris was Charles VII., whose reign had begun
with a full measure of disaster and misfortune, but who
had succeeded, in his later years, in the task of consolidating
his kingdom and in securing for his subjects,
long harassed by wars and invasions, some years of peace
and prosperity. During his stormy reign, Charles could
not have enjoyed much leisure for the cultivation of
literature, but he is described by his biographers as an
appreciative patron of learning and as possessing an intelligent
interest in scholarship. It is probable, therefore,
that if it had not been for his unexpected death in 1461,
the beginning of printing in Paris would have been advanced
by a decade, and that, with the aid of royal favour
and influence, Paris would have taken a much more
important place than it did among the earlier publishing
centres of Europe.</p>

<p>Louis XI., the son of Charles, during his reign of twenty-two
years, busied as he was with the work of securing a
firm foundation for the authority of the Crown, was not
able to devote much thought to the interests of literature.
He found time, however, to reorganise the Library of the
Louvre, which had been founded in 1369, by Charles V.
(the Wise), and the continuation of which is represented
to-day by the <i>Bibliothèque Nationale</i>. Louis, while characterised
as miserly, was also known as a collector of
choice books, and was an important patron of certain
scribes and illuminators, among others, of Jean Fouquet
of Tours.</p>

<p>It was in 1462 that the first examples of printed books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
were seen in Paris. In that year, Fust brought from
Mayence a supply of his folio Bible, copies of which he
was able to sell for fifty crowns. The usual price for
manuscripts of this compass had been from four to five
hundred crowns. It seems probable that there was little
or no foundation for the stories that were, later, told of
Fust’s being harshly treated as a magician, on the ground
that the volumes he was offering for sale could not have
been produced by human hands, or without the aid of
the powers of evil. There was a manifest improbability
in the idea that Satan would interest himself in securing
a wider circulation for the holy Scriptures, unless possibly
he had taken occasion to inject into falsified texts some
heretical or pernicious doctrine. It is probable also that,
by the time of Fust’s arrival, more or less information
must already have reached Paris about the new art, and
that, while it was still regarded as mysterious and wonderful,
it was recognised as a human invention that had in
other cities already been applied to practical uses.</p>

<p>The first publishing office in Paris was founded, in 1469,
at the request of two <i>savants</i> of the Sorbonne, Fichet and
Heynlin, by Gering, Krantz, and Friburger from Constance.
The work was carried on in one of the Halls of
the Sorbonne. Forty years later, there were in Paris
over fifty printing concerns. The policy of cordial encouragement
still prevailed, and no restrictions had as yet
been placed upon the business. After the introduction
of printing, the printers took a position in society much
above that occupied by their predecessors, the copyists.
The difference could have been due only in part to the
possession of greater scholarly attainments, for the better
class of copyists must themselves have had some knowledge
of the subject-matter of their manuscripts. The
business of the printers required, however, the control of
a certain amount of capital, while the selection of works
for reproduction and the preparation for the compositors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of trustworthy texts called for a wide range of literary
information and scholarly training. The printers were,
in the first place, left as free as had been the copyists to
reproduce such works as they might select. No claim
had thus far been made for exclusive ownership in, or
control of, literary productions, and no censorship supervision
had been established on the part of the Government.
This state of things continued during the reign of
Louis XII., and, in an edict issued April 9, 1513,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the
King confirmed and extended the privileges previously
acquired by booksellers as officials of the University.</p>

<p>In this edict, Louis speaks with great appreciation and
admiration of the printing art, “the discovery of which
appears to be rather divine than human.” He congratulates
his kingdom that in the development of this art
“France takes precedence of all other realms.” A year
later, the King put on record his opinion that dramatic
productions and representations should be left free from
any restrictions. In 1512, the King writes to the University
requesting the Faculty to examine a book which the
Council of Pisa had condemned as heretical. In place,
however, of demanding or suggesting that measures of
severity should be taken against the writer of the book,
the King proposed that the professors should have the
book gone over chapter by chapter and should put into
form a refutation of any of its conclusions which seemed
to them to be contrary to the truth.</p>

<p>It was hardly possible that so wide a spirit of toleration
should long continue. Francis I. prided himself on his
taste for literature and was disposed to favour men of letters,
but his fancies for toleration were easily overcome
by the persecuting earnestness which actuated the clergy
and the Parliament, and when his anger or his suspicions
had once been aroused, he showed himself to be fiercer in
the infliction of penalties than those whom he had at first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>restrained. The spirit of the time was stronger than any
one king, and it would be absurd to suppose that in the
sixteenth century the Church and the State could be
depended upon to permit the free development and the
unrestricted expression of thought.</p>

<p>The first book printed in Paris by Gering and his associates
was a collection of the <i>Letters</i> of Gasparino of Bergamo.
The volume was in Latin, and the Roman form
of type was used, notwithstanding the German control of
the office. Humphreys is of opinion that specimens of
the beautiful volumes which had been printed in Venice
by Jenson had been forwarded to Paris, and that these
served as models for the earlier issues of the Paris Press.
The <i>Gasparino</i> was followed by an edition of Sallust’s
<i>Catiline Conspiracy</i> and by an epitome of <i>Livy</i> compiled
by Florus. A little later, appeared a work on Rhetoric
by Fichet himself, one of the earliest printed volumes
which was the production of a contemporary writer.</p>

<p>The second Press established in Paris was that of
Cæsaris and Stoll, who began work for themselves in
1473. They were both students of the University but
they found it desirable to carry on their business outside
of the University limits. The demand in Paris, both
within and without the University, for printed books,
increased very rapidly, and before the close of the century
the trade in books far exceeded that of any city in Europe.
For a number of years, however, a very large proportion
of this demand was supplied from the presses of Mayence,
Strasburg, Venice, Milan, Cologne, and Bruges.</p>

<p>Schoiffher, or Schöffer, of Mayence, was the first of the
foreign publishers who maintained a permanent agency in
Paris. This agency naturally excited the jealousy of the
licensed Paris book-dealers, and, in 1474, the stock was
seized on an application from the Guild on the ground
that it was the property of an alien who was not a licensed
dealer. Louis XI. gave evidence, however, that his interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
in the new art was superior to any local or national
prejudice, and, on a petition from Schoiffher, he caused to
be paid over to him the sum of four hundred crowns as
an indemnification for the loss of his books. In 1474, the
King also granted to Gering and his associates letters
of naturalisation which secured a protection for their
business.</p>

<p>The first volume printed in Paris in French was <i>Les
Grandes Chroniques de France</i>, which was issued in 1477,
by Pâquier Bonhomme, bookseller to the University.
This was, however, not the first printed book that had
appeared in French, as it had been preceded, by some
years, by the <i>Recueil des Histoires de Troyes</i> published in
Bruges by Caxton. In 1495, Anthony Vérard, who had
previously been an illuminator and probably also an engraver
of block-books, established a printing-office and
devoted himself particularly to the production of illustrated
works. In 1503, he printed in English, for sale in
the English market, the <i>Art of Good Living and Dying</i>,
the illustrations in which occupy about as much space as
the text.</p>

<p>After Paris, Lyons was the city of France in which the
art of printing secured the earliest introduction and the
most rapid development. The printer-publishers of Lyons
showed themselves “enterprising” in more ways than one.
They were free from the immediate supervision and control
of the authorities of the University of Paris, and, as
the history of the Paris Press shows, the difficulties placed
in the way of publishing undertakings by the bigoted and
ignorant censorship of the theologians, must have more
than offset the advantages usually to be secured in the production
of scholarly publications, through the facilities of
the University collections and the editorial service rendered
by the University members.</p>

<p>In the matter of political censorship, Lyons was, of
course, in form at least, subject to the same regulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
that controlled the presses of Paris. It was, however,
evidently much more difficult to exercise any strict and
continuous supervision over the printers of the provinces
than over those of the capital, and in politics, therefore,
as well as in theology, the publishers of Lyons enjoyed a
greater freedom of action. “The freedom of action,” of
which their Paris competitors made the sharpest criticism
and the most reiterated complaints, was shown in the
practice of the Lyons competitors, of promptly appropriating
for their own profit and reproducing, with more or
less closeness of imitation, such of the Paris publications
as they found available for the markets within their reach.
The “privileges” issued by the Crown and the special
authorisations given by the University appear to have
availed but little to repress this appropriating enterprise
on the part of the publishers of Lyons.</p>

<p>It was no consolation to the organised publishers, <i>les
libraires jurés</i>, to know that their Lyons competitors
utilised, with precisely the same freedom, the available
publications of Venice, Milan, Mayence, and Basel, and,
later, of Geneva. For this class of reprinting there was,
as a rule, not even the nominal obstacle of the State
privilege. As a result of their favourable commercial
position, the publishers of Lyons were not infrequently
able to secure for their unauthorised reprints of the classic
editions of the Paris Press a much larger proportion of
the foreign sales than was obtained by the original
publishers.</p>

<p>The enterprise of these early Lyons publishers was
manifested also in another and more legitimate direction.
They gave attention to the production of books in light
literature, such as popular romances, legends, folk-songs,
etc., printed, of course, in the vernacular, at a time when
the printers of Paris and, for that matter, the printers of
nearly all the other book-manufacturing cities of Europe
were devoting their presses exclusively to theology and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
the classics. Other cities the printers of which interested
themselves in light literature were Bruges and London,
the records of which are referred to in another chapter.</p>

<p>In connection with these romances and with some few
other classes of literature, the book-makers of Lyons gave
particular attention to the production of high-class illustrations.
They used for the purpose the work not only
of French, but of foreign designers and engravers. The
printer Le Roys, for instance, employed Holbein to design
a new <i>Dance of Death</i>, and also to prepare a series of
illustrations for the New Testament. In 1488, Jacques
Locher published an edition of the famous <i>Ship of Fools</i>,
accompanied by graphic illustrations from an unknown
artist. Locher’s edition was issued in Latin. The first
French translation, under the title <i>La Nef des Fouls</i>, appeared
in 1497. This was followed a little later by a
companion work published under the title of <i>La Nef des
Folles</i>, which illustrated in like manner the absurdities of
women in various walks of life.</p>

<p>The first Paris printer who was able to present in his
text any Greek characters was Jodocus Badius, who issued,
in 1505, the <i>Annotationes in Novum Testamentum</i> of Laurentius
Valla, in which several passages of Greek were of
necessity included. In 1519, the same publisher issued
an impression of the <i>Institutiones Imperiales</i>, in which
were included a few Greek passages. The characters for
the type used in these were designed by a certain Hermonymus,
a Lacedæmonian, who was at the time sojourning
in Paris.</p>

<p>In 1507, a Greek Press was established in Paris by Giles
Gourmont. The Press was under the general supervision
of the University, but the immediate responsibility for
the undertaking rested with Francis Tissard. Tissard
was a French scholar, who, having studied in Padua and
Bologna, had become imbued with an earnest zeal for the
development of classical scholarship in France. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
secured instruction in Greek from a certain Demetrius
Spartiata, and it was his special object to establish in the
University of Paris the study of Greek language and literature,
and to bring the cost of Greek books within the
means of the poorer instructors and students. The few
scholars in France who had heretofore been interested in
Greek books had been obliged to incur the expense of
securing these from Milan or from Venice.</p>

<p>Tissard succeeded in interesting in his undertaking the
Duke de Valois, who afterwards, as Francis I., rendered
most important service to the cause of literature for
France and for Europe. As the first Greek book issued
from the Press of Aldus, twelve years earlier, had very
properly been a <i>Grammar</i> for the instruction in Greek of
students already proficient in Latin, in like manner the
volume selected by Tissard as the first issue from Gourmont’s
Press was an elementary work containing the
Greek alphabet, the rules of pronunciation, and exercises
for the beginner.</p>

<p>The second Greek publication was the <i>Batrachomyomachia</i>,
and the third, an edition of the <i>Works and Days</i> of
Hesiod (probably the first printed issue of this author).
The fourth Greek volume was the <i>Grammar</i> of Emanuel
Chrysoloras, a Greek scholar, whose influence had been of
so great service in furthering the study of Greek literature
in Florence.</p>

<p>After the publication of this <i>Grammar</i>, Gourmont
assumed the title which he had fairly earned, <i>Primus
Græcarum Litterarum Parisiis Impressor</i>. In the following
year, he established his claim to the like honourable
distinction for the Hebrew, by his impression of two
works from the zealous pen of his scholarly patron Tissard,
the <i>Grammatica Hebraica et Græca</i>, in quarto, and
the <i>Alphabetum Hebraicum et Græcum</i>, also in quarto.</p>

<p>Shortly after the issue of these two volumes, Tissard
died. His work as the supervising scholar of the Greek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Press in Paris was carried on by Hieronymus Aleander,
an Italian scholar who had been invited by Louis XII.
to take up his residence in Paris. Aleander gave lectures
in the forenoon in the University on the language and
literature of Greece, while the evenings were devoted to
readings in Cicero. In the year 1512, he was elected
Rector of the University, and in this position and by
means of a liberal use of the pension given him by the
King, he was able to do much in furthering the development
of the printing, in Paris, of Greek texts. In the
year 1512, Aleander gave to the public a <i>Lexicon Græco-Latinum</i>,
which bore the imprint of Gourmontius and
Bolsecus, the latter being the second Greek typographer
of Paris.</p>

<p>Aleander had been a member of the Academy of
Aldus, who inscribed to him his edition of <i>Homeri Ilias
Græce</i>, and who speaks in high terms of his literary qualifications.
Aleander had also been a friend and literary
associate of Erasmus, and had given to the learned Hollander
valuable assistance in the compilation of his <i>Adagia</i>.
This friendship failed to stand the test of religious differences,
and Aleander, when later employed by Leo X.
to combat the doctrines of the Lutheran heretics, exercised
his tongue and pen with great acrimony against the
Sage of Rotterdam.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The next printer in Paris whose work, in connection
with the production of classic literature, was important,
was Jodocus Badius Ascensius. According to the record
of the historian Panzer, there were produced from the
Press of Badius not less than four hundred separate works,
nearly all of which were printed in folio or quarto. The
business career of Badius extended over a period of about
twenty-five years, beginning with 1498. It is difficult to
understand how it was practicable to secure at this early
age a remunerative sale for costly editions of the Latin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>authors selected by Badius for his Press. He was a
Fleming by birth, and, as was the case with not a few of
the early printer-publishers, he united with his other
business responsibilities work as an instructor. He gave
lectures on the Latin poets, first in Paris and later in
Lyons. It was in the latter city that he first interested
himself in printing, having been engaged by Preschel as a
corrector of the press. One of the more noteworthy of
his publications, outside of the list of Latin classics, was
an edition of the <i>Philobiblon</i> of Richard de Bury. He
was also the publisher of the first Paris edition of the
<i>Navis Stultifera</i> (the “Ship of Fools”) of Sebastian
Brandt. Of this book he also printed a translation in
French, (the second French version) under the title of <i>La
Nef des Folz du Monde</i>, which was edited by himself and
with which he included certain variations of his own. It
may be considered as an evidence of the accepted orthodoxy
of Badius that he was employed by the University
to publish certain censorial works which had been prepared
<i>ex cathedra</i> by members of the Theological Faculty.
Examples of these, printed respectively in 1521 and 1523,
were treatises on the doctrine of Luther and on “certain
contentions of Dr. Luther.” Among the more important
works of later and contemporary authors that came from
the Press of Badius were editions of the <i>Opera Omnia</i> of
Politian and of the <i>Opera Omnia</i> of Valla, and a long
series of works by Budæus, who ranked as one of the
most comprehensive and voluminous scholars of his time.
In 1500, Badius printed an edition of the <i>Regula S.
Benedicti</i>, the famous Rule which, as described in an
earlier chapter, had exercised so important and so abiding
an influence on the literature and the intellectual development
of Europe.</p>

<p>Badius was a <i>libraire juré</i> of the University, and the
thoroughness of his scholarship was attested by so good
an authority as Erasmus, for whom he published editions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of the <i>Adagia</i> and the <i>Praise of Folly</i>. The printing mark
of Badius is a representation of the printing-press of the
time. Beneath this he occasionally used the motto <i>Aere
meret Badius laudem auctorum arte legentum</i>. Greswell
says that by filling up the ellipsis, this is to be interpreted
that Badius by his liberality elicits the praise of authors,
and by his typographic skill and accuracy that of readers.</p>

<p>Budæus, whose friendship and scholarship were of
marked service to Badius during his career, was one of the
most noteworthy scholars of his generation and is to be
ranked in the group with Erasmus, among the great
scholars of Europe. He had studied Greek with Laskaris,
whose lectures and whose Greek grammar had done
so much to further the study in Italy of the language and
literature of Greece. Three of the kings of France, Charles
VIII., Louis XII., and Francis I., appreciating the distinction
given to France by the scholarship and literary
productions of a man like Budæus, had honoured him with
their friendship and had bestowed upon him various
marks of distinction. It was a time when learning was
held to be an essential qualification for diplomacy and
statesmanship, and Budæus was more than once called
away from his study and from his lecture-room to take
charge of important embassies. In 1520, he was in
attendance upon Francis I. at the celebrated meeting
between Francis and Henry VIII. on the Field of the
Cloth of Gold.</p>

<p>The subsequent interest taken by Francis in the work
of the University and in the foundation of the Royal
Library at Fontainebleau was doubtless due to the influence
of Budæus, and it was in his power so to educate
the King as to enable the latter to realise the value and
importance to the kingdom of the work that was being
done by the printer-publisher, and to be ready to further
this work with the royal protection, with privileges, and at
times with direct financial aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Estiennes.</h3><p class="heading">—The history of the production of
books during the first century after the invention of
printing is, of necessity, in the main a record of the lives
and of the work of certain typical printer-publishers upon
whom fell the responsibility of initiating and of shaping
the literary undertakings of their time. The business
carried on by these early publishers differed very materially
from that of their successors. All the machinery of
book-making had to be originated or created, while it was
necessary also to establish channels of distribution, and
through these to discover and to educate a reading public
which should absorb the productions of the new presses.
The task of selecting the works which were best adapted
for the requirements of the first buyers of printed books,
of securing trustworthy texts of these works, of editing
these texts, and of supervising their type-setting, called
for a large measure of literary judgment and scholarly
knowledge, combined with a capacity for organising and
directing an editorial staff. There was also necessity for
the gift of imagination, through which could be pictured
literary conditions and creations for which there were as
yet no precedents. And finally, steps had to be taken
for securing a legal status for the new class of property
that was being brought into existence, in order that some
portion at least of the rights and advantages assured by
the State to owners of other classes of property might be
enjoyed by the producers of literature. In the absence
of any accepted principles or precedents, it became necessary
to convince princes, ministers, councils, and parliaments
that it was for the interests of the community to
encourage the production of literature, and that this
could be done only by establishing and defending
property rights for the producers.</p></div>

<p>At this stage in the history of book-production, the
“producers,” the men who brought into existence the
current literature of the time, and who, having planned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and initiated the undertakings, taken the risks, met the
outlay, and provided the labour (in many cases with their
own heads and hands), claimed the ownership of the works
produced, were the publishers. The literature with which
the publishing of printed books was entered upon was comprised,
with a few rare <span class ="err" title="original: exception">exceptions</span>, of editions of old-time
classics, prepared to meet the requirements of the scholars
of the day. It was for this class of publications that were
secured the first “protections” and “privileges,” and the
labour of extracting such privileges from the rulers first
of one State and then of another, until a sufficient territory
to provide a market for the work had, at least in
form, been protected, fell of course upon the publishers.</p>

<p>These “privileges” were for but brief and varying
terms, and often (as in the small States of Italy and Germany)
the territory covered by any one privilege was
very inconsiderable; while it was further the case that
the penalties for infringement were absurdly inadequate,
and could but rarely be enforced. The protection afforded
to property rights was, therefore, for the most part unsatisfactory
enough, but it was the best that in the existing
state of public opinion could be secured. The system of
privileges marked an epoch in the history of human relations
and in the development of the recognition of
human rights, and it constituted, of course, the beginning
of the later system of copyright law.</p>

<p>The special labours of the earlier publishers were not
even completed when they had secured for their productions
the protection, at least <i>pro forma</i>, of the State.
They still had upon their hands the work of conciliating
the Church, and, as has been noted in the account of
Aldus, and as will appear in the later chapters, the task
of creating and of carrying on the business of publishing
of books for scholarly and critical readers was enormously
increased by the burdens and the exactions of a zealous
and ignorant ecclesiastical censorship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p>The printer-publishers of the first century of printing
who, in the face of this complex series of difficulties,
responsibilities, and requirements, succeeded in creating a
business and in producing for their own generation and
for posterity long lists of costly and scholarly editions of
the great books of their world, may fairly be called men
of achievement.</p>

<p>With the requirement came, as always, the men. The
press that Gutenberg had given to the world was not
allowed to rust for want of plucky and public-spirited
printers to develop its full scope and usefulness. In
Italy, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and England,
scholarly and capable pioneers devoted themselves to the
new art until it had become “understanded of the
people,” had made a place for itself in the community,
and could be pursued as an industry and without the
necessity of exceptional individuals for its direction. Not
a few of these pioneer publishers founded families or
dynasties which for successive generations continued to
discharge the responsibility of providing high-class literature
for the community, and at the same time of fighting
ecclesiastical and political censorships, of widening precedents,
and of maintaining and extending the claims of
literature and the rights of literary producers.</p>

<p>I have already noted for Italy the achievements of
Aldus Manutius and his successors, and I propose in later
chapters (selecting a few of the more typical of the great
printer-publishers) to give some description of the work
of the Kobergers in Nuremberg, of Froben in Basel, of
the House of Plantin in Antwerp, of Caxton in Bruges
and in London, and of the Elzevirs in Leyden and Amsterdam.</p>

<p>For France, after the foregoing brief references to the
undertakings of the earliest printers, some special mention
is fairly due to the famous family of the Estiennes
or Stephani, the members of which took rank not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
with the great publishers but with the distinguished
scholars of their time, while they are also to be commemorated
as having, in troublous times, shown themselves
to be strong-hearted men, possessing the courage of
their convictions. No other family, excepting possibly
that of the Elzevirs, was for so many generations engaged
in the business of printing and publishing, while the work
of the Stephani was carried on under exceptional difficulties,
commercial, literary, theological, and political.
The editorial responsibility in preparing for the press the
scholarly publications of later publishers was for the
most part confided to professors or other scholarly associates,
but it was the case that the books issued by the
Stephani were, with a few exceptions, edited and supervised
by the publishers themselves, nearly all the members
of the family being men of scholarly training, while
one or two took rank with the most learned men of their
generation. No publisher, except Aldus of Venice, has
ever contributed to the issues of his press as much original
scholarly work as is to be found in the books bearing the
imprint of Robert Stephanus.</p>

<p>The founder of the family, or at least the man whose
name first becomes known in connection with the production
of books, was Henry, known as Henry the elder, in
order to be distinguished from his grandson. His name
first appears as a printer in the year 1496, in conjunction
with that of a German named Wolffgang Hopyll.
The book bearing this double imprint was an introduction
to the <i>Ethics</i> of Aristotle, written by a certain
Jacobus Faber. The first book issued by Estienne bearing
his sole imprint, and which may therefore be considered
as the earliest publication of a House whose
business was to continue for nearly a century and a half,
was an edition of the <i>Ethics</i> of Aristotle, Latinised by
Aretinus, which bears date 1504. According to Panzer,
Henry Estienne the first published in all about one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
separate works, which, with hardly an exception,
were issued in Latin. He associated with the editorial
work of his printing-office three learned doctors, Charles
Boville, Jacques Le Fèvre d’Estaples, and Josse Clictou.
Le Fèvre is known as the instructor of the reformers Calvin
and Farrel. His so-called heretical opinions rendered
him obnoxious to the Doctors of the Sorbonne, and if it
had not been for the special interference of Francis I., by
whom his learning and his merits were held in high esteem,
his life would more than once have been in jeopardy.
His theological opponents succeeded, however, in procuring
his expulsion from the University, and, driven
from Paris, he was compelled to seek the protection of
the Queen of Navarre.</p>

<p>The case above cited is one of a long series of instances
in which the liberal views and the scholarly interests of
King Francis brought him into conflict with the Doctors
of the Sorbonne. In the end, however, the Theological Faculty,
backed by the majority of the ecclesiastics of France
and by the continued influence of the papacy, proved too
strong for the liberal tendencies of the Crown. With the
final triumph of Catholic orthodoxy in France, the leading
publishers and their editorial associates found so many
difficulties placed in the way of their literary undertakings,
that these could no longer be carried on to advantage
in Paris. While it was the case that a large number of
these publishers and of their authors were in sympathy
with the views of the Reformers, this formed only the
smaller part of the difficulty. The chief trouble was due
to the ignorance and the suspiciousness of the Doctors of
the Sorbonne. These doctors possessed at this period
little or no knowledge of Greek, and were inclined to imagine
that any Greek sentence must contain, or might
contain, some dangerous heresy. Any critical analysis of
Latin texts which, in some earlier and usually imperfect or
defective form, had received the approval of the Church,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
also seemed to them likely to prove dangerous, and in
any case constituted a reflection upon the orthodox
scholarship of the previously accepted versions. Their
apprehensions became most keen and their indignation
most active when the “new criticism” (as they probably
called it) was applied to the text of the Scriptures, whether
for the purpose of correcting the early, clumsy, Latinised
versions of the New Testament, or of securing more accurate
rendering of the texts of the Hebrew books. The
production of editions of the Scriptures constituted, however,
during the first half century of printing, the most
important division of publishing undertakings. It is not
surprising, therefore, that the printers, who were giving
their time and their capital to the preparation of these
editions, and who found themselves hampered and harassed
by ignorant and bigoted censorship, came to the
conclusion that the advantages of Paris as a literary and
commercial centre were not sufficient to offset the continued
difficulties and annoyances of such antagonism. If
the publishing business of Geneva received, after the beginning
of the Reformation, an exceptional impetus and
development through the migration of Paris publishers
and the transfer of the literary undertakings of French
scholars, the responsibility for the loss to France must
rest first with the Doctors of the Sorbonne, and secondly
with the weakness and vacillation of the successors of
Francis I.</p>

<p>Henry Estienne associated with his imprint the arms
of the University, but he had no exclusive control of such
use, as these same arms appear on the title-pages of the
publications of one or two of his contemporaries. He
appears to have been one of the first of Paris printers to
assume a personal responsibility for the typographical accuracy
of his texts, and in securing the services of competent
scholars as correctors for his Press, he made a practice
of adding their names to the title-pages or to the colophons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of their editions. This served at once to secure for them
the credit of good work and to fix the responsibility for
work that did not stand the test of later criticism. Greswell
mentions that the celebrated scholar Beatus Rhenanus
was at one time discharged by Henry from the post
of press corrector, because he had permitted certain errors
or oversights to remain in the printed text as passed by
him. Henry took the ground that the publishing imprint
should stand as a voucher or guarantee for trustworthy
work and that every typographical error constituted a
stain upon his character as a publisher.</p>

<p>Henry died about 1520. The work of his Press was at
the outset continued by Colines, who married his widow.
Colines gave special attention to the production of impressions
of the best Latin classics, and was the first of
Paris printers to adopt for these the italic type and the
more convenient cabinet or sixteenmo form which had
been first utilised by Aldus. Robert Estienne, the most
famous printer of his name, owed to his step-father his
typographical education, and it must have been largely
due also to the influence of Colines that the taste of the
young Robert was from the beginning directed to the
dissemination of classical literature.</p>

<p>The editions of Colines included a very full list of the
leading Latin authors, special attention being given (as
was the case with nearly all the printers of the first and
second generations) to the writings of Cicero. In preparing
the works of Cicero for the press, Colines had the
advantage of the carefully revised and ably annotated
text of Paul Manutius, the son of Aldus. The most important
of the works of contemporary writers which bore
the imprint of Colines was an edition of the <i>Colloquies</i> of
Erasmus, which was issued with the authorisation of the
author, by whom it had been carefully revised. The sale
and perusal of this book were interdicted by the censor of
the Sorbonne, but before it was withdrawn from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
market there were printed, according to the account
given by Erasmus, no less than twenty-four thousand
copies.</p>

<p>The chief prestige that attaches to the undertakings
of Colines was secured through his beautiful editions of
works in the Greek character. The list of these comprised
in all fourteen separate issues, including his three
impressions of <i>Euclid</i>. As a <i>libraire juré</i> of the University,
Colines was employed to print the Acts of the
Council of Sens, in which council, in the year 1528, the
Lutheran heresies were condemned. He also printed,
probably in his official capacity, a number of the tracts or
treatises which were issued under the direction of the
Theological Faculty to combat the Protestant heresies.
To his long list of publications must be added a complete
edition of the works of <i>Galen</i>, which was followed by
several other medical treatises.</p>

<p>As has been previously pointed out, up to the year
1507, the University of Paris was practically destitute of
texts for the study of Greek, although for nearly twenty
years, in the universities of Italy, Greek lecturers had
found a large support for their work, and although, since
1495, the presses of Aldus in Venice had been busied in
the production of carefully edited and well printed editions
of the Greek classics. While it is probable that
there was no serious difficulty in securing in Paris at this
time copies of the issues of the Venetian Press, it would
appear that the knowledge of Greek in the University
and the interest in acquiring such knowledge prior to
1510 had been very inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The Greek exiles from Constantinople who had done
so much to further in Italy an enthusiasm for Greek literature,
not only in the university towns but in great commercial
centres like Florence and Venice, had apparently
been less attracted towards France, and it was not until
later in the sixteenth century that we find the names of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Greek instructors associated with the Faculties of Paris
and Orleans. Greek had been taught in Paris as early as
1472, by a certain Tiphernas, an Italian, who had been a
pupil of Chrysoloras. He was succeeded after a considerable
interval by Hermonymus and Laskaris. The
latter was the author of the famous <i>Grammar</i>, which was
the first Greek publication of Aldus. According to Greswell,
Laskaris never secured any official appointment in
the University, although he had the favour of Charles
VIII. and of Louis XII.</p>

<p>Gourmont, whose name has already been mentioned,
was the first of the Paris typographers who was willing to
incur the very considerable risk and expense required for
the production of a series of Greek texts. His list included
an edition of the <i>Institutiones Grammaticæ</i> of
Aldus Manutius, issued in 1513, and the <i>Grammatica
Græca</i> of Theodore Gaza, in 1521. In 1522, Pierre
Vidouvé, of Verneuil, printed the <i>Dragmata Græcæ Litteraturæ</i>
of John Œcolampadius, and a Greek and Latin
Lexicon edited by Magnus and Chæradamus. The former
was preceptor to the children of Budæus.</p>

<p>These ventures were followed by similar undertakings
on the part of Colines and Badius. The former issued
editions of <i>Sophocles, Aristophanes, Demosthenes</i>, and
<i>Lucian</i>, while from the press of the latter came the great
<i>Commentary</i> of Budæus on the Greek language, and the
<i>Areopagiticus</i> of Isocrates.</p>

<p>Another Greek printer of enterprise was Christianus
Wechel, who was a friend of Erasmus. He issued, in
1529, a further edition of the frequently printed Greek
<i>Grammar</i> of Gaza, and, later, many of the <i>Opuscula</i> of
Galen, the latter printed in the original Greek with Latin
versions. Wechel came into trouble in 1534 for having
sold the treatise of Erasmus <i>De esu interdicto Carnium</i>,
which had been censured by the Theological Faculty.</p>

<p>In the year 1530, the production of Greek books in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Paris was taken up energetically by Gerardus Morrhius
Campensis, who dates his impressions from the College of
the Sorbonne. His list includes a <i>Lexicon Græco-Latinum</i>,
the <i>Rhetorica</i> and <i>Poetica</i> of Aristotle, the <i>Ajax</i> of
Sophocles, and a number of the essays of Galen. The
titles of the works selected by these earlier Parisian printers
have interest as indicating the direction of the
studies pursued at the time in the University, or which
were taken up in connection with special scholarly undertakings
outside of the routine university curriculum.
While these printer-publishers were usually able to secure,
in preparing their editions for the press, the services of
scholarly editors (or, as they were more frequently called,
correctors), it is evident that no little original learning as
well as scholarly judgment was required on the part of
the publishers themselves in the selection of the texts and
in the supervision of the correctors, while in the majority
of cases the publishers added to their volumes original
work of their own. Thus to the <i>Lexicon Græco-Latinum</i>,
Morrhius had contributed an elaborate Latin preface,
while to the <i>Interpretatio Didymi in Odysseam</i>, he prefixed
an analytical introduction in Greek.</p>

<p>Morrhius, writing in 1531 to Erasmus, says: “There
are even within the precincts of this college [the Sorbonne]
those who wish well to you, but they are obliged to
whisper, fearing to declare in public their real sentiments,
to such a pitch has tyranny attained here. Your friends
rejoice exceedingly that you have replied with so much
moderation to the <i>Determinationes</i> of our divines, for they
were afraid you would have branded the whole Faculty
with a stigma that would have marked them to posterity,
which you would have certainly been justified in doing.”
It is apparent from this and from many similar references
that Erasmus was obliged to carry on contentions, so to
speak, with both hands. On the one side, he was bitterly
assailed by Lutherans no less than by Calvinists for failing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
to support with his talents, his learning, and his world-wide
influence the cause of the Protestants. On the
other side, the divines of the Roman Church stigmatised
as a dangerous heretic a man who insisted that the writings
of the Fathers, and even the Roman versions of the
Scriptures themselves, must be subjected to critical analysis
and to textual corrections, and that not a few of the
<i>dicta</i>, which had been made the basis of doctrines called
authoritative, were either fraudulent interpolations in the
original texts, or were the result of the glosses and blunders
of incompetent copyists.</p>

<p>Vascosanus, who was a son-in-law of Badius, continued
the work of printing classic texts, and won repute for the
beauty and correctness of his editions. He interested
himself particularly in the production of the works of
Cicero, printed in quarto with commentaries. The writings
of Cicero were, as we shall note, very largely favoured
by the publishers of the first century of printing. The
only important contemporary author with whose work the
imprint of Vascosanus is associated, was Budæus, for
whom he published an edition of the treatise <i>De Asse et
ejus Partibus</i>. The device adopted by Vascosanus was a
fountain, delineated, according to Maittaire’s description,
with artistic ornaments, and surrounded by the motto,
ἐν βιβλίοισ ῥέει ἡ Σοφίας πηγὴ.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> From 1566 to 1576,
Vascosanus was <i>Typographus Regius</i>. The great typographer,
Frederic Morel, was one of his grandsons.</p>

<p>Without undertaking to give in detail the list of the
printer-publishers who are recorded by Maittaire and Greswell
as having rendered honourable service during this
period in the production in Paris of scholarly Latin and
Greek texts, I will proceed at once to the record of Robert
Estienne, whose work was of first importance for France
and for Europe, and who is to be ranked with the great
printer-publishers of the world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>
<p>Robert’s responsibilities as a printer in his own name
begin with 1524, in which year he became proprietor of
the paternal <i>Imprimerie</i>. He was then twenty-one years
of age. He had been able to profit but little from the
training of his father, Henry, the first of the Estiennes
who had devoted himself to printing, as the latter had
died when Robert was but seventeen, but he had, as before
noted, had the advantage of the supervision of his
step-father Colines, himself both a skilled printer and a
good scholar. The work of the young printer was begun
in troublous times both for France and for Europe. It
was but eight years since, by the burning at Wittenberg
of the papal bull, Luther had initiated the great contest
of the Reformation. The wordy strife of the theologians
was proceeding with increasing bitterness throughout all
Christian lands, and behind the theological contentions of
the scholars, the feelings of the common people were being
aroused into a condition of ferment and dogmatic
partisanship such as the world had not yet witnessed, and
which was for years to come, in the name of Christianity,
to bring desolation upon many lands. This excited condition
of France, Germany, and Switzerland, the desolating
wars which followed, the absorption of the minds of
men in theological issues, and the measures for a repressing
censorship of the productions of the printing-press,
which, immediately after the beginning of the Reformation,
were instituted by the authorities both of Church
and of State, were, of necessity, serious obstacles in the
way of development of publishing undertakings, or at
least of undertakings depending upon purely literary interests.
On the other hand, the general ferment in the
minds of men, a ferment which, as we have noted, was
by no means confined to the scholarly circles, brought
about a very great development in the intellectual activities
and the literary interests of Europe, causing “many to
read who never read before, while those who read before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
now read the more.” Mark Pattison points out that the
Reformation was not only an appeal to Scripture versus
tradition, but also “an appeal to history.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The makers
of such an appeal must, of course, in order to render their
contention effective, place within the reach of their communities
the literature of the history cited as authoritative.
The printing-press had been in use for three quarters
of a century, but the demand for books had still (as in the
manuscript period) been in large part restricted to the
scholarly circles of the universities and of the educated
ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>It was only with the eager popular demand for instruction
and information which developed with the outbreak
of the Reformation, that there came to the people at large
a realisation of the value to them of the invention of
Gutenberg, and an understanding of its importance for
the work of educating and of organising the people
for the securing of the right of individual thought and
for protection against the oppression of Church and State.
The work of publishing material for popular circulation
begins practically with the Reformation. As the people
came to realise the value of the new weapon that had
been shaped for its use, there was developed a corresponding
distrust and antagonism on the part of the
Church (which had at first been a liberal supporter of the
printers), and on the part also of not a few of the State
rulers. The system of censorship, ecclesiastical and political,
a system which was to do much to hamper the
development of literature and of publishing, dates in substance
from the Reformation; no censorship, however
rigorous, was competent to restrain the growing activity
of the press, an activity itself awakened by the increase
in the popular demand for literature, and, notwithstanding
all the difficulties above referred to, the reading
public within reach of Robert Estienne was very much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>greater than that which twenty-five or thirty years back
had been available for his father. At the time Robert began
his business career, Francis I. was King of France,
Charles V., Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Henry
VIII., King of England. The Paris of 1524 contained
about 350,000 inhabitants. The University, which under
Louis XI. was said to have comprised over 20,000 students,
had seriously declined, and was destined to lose
still more during the succeeding century as the Romanist
spirit secured the complete control. It included, however,
under Francis, not less than 10,000 students, and
must still have ranked as the leading university of Europe.
The printer-publishers of the city carried on their work in
close connection with the University, of which, in fact,
under the system handed down from the manuscript
period, the <i>libraires jurés</i> were still members, and the
University continued to claim the right to control such
supervision and censorship as might be exercised over the
productions of the press. The syndic of the Sorbonne
(the theological division of the University) was at this
time Noel Bedier, who affected the name of Beda, after
the venerable Bede. He is described as a fanatical pedant
and an incessant disputant, always on the lookout for
heresy and for some new victim to persecute.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It was a
gratification to him to have been born in this age of
heterodoxy, and he was constantly goading the Sorbonne
to censure.</p>

<p>King Francis gave evidence of an intelligent appreciation
of the importance, as well for the prestige of the
Crown as for the welfare of the State, of the development
of learning and literature. He showed a cordial regard for
the scholarly publishers and editors who were at that time
gathered in Paris, and was ready in most instances to
throw the influence of the Crown upon the side of a
liberal standard of supervision for the productions of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Paris Press. The authority of the University, on the other
hand, as expressed through the Theological Faculty of the
Sorbonne, was, from the time of the beginning of the
Reformation, exercised persistently in behalf of a narrower
and more rigorous censorship, and was used to restrict
and to hamper nearly all classes of publishing
undertakings. Behind the Sorbonne stood the Church of
Rome. The co-operation of the Papacy with the literary
spirit of the age, appears to have come to an end with the
death of Leo X. His successors, Adrian VI., Clement
VII., and Paul III., had learned to regard the printing-press
as an efficient ally of the Reformers, and therefore
as the enemy of the Church. They had convinced themselves
that if the spread of pernicious doctrine among the
people was to be checked, the issues of the press must be
controlled by a rigorous and persistent censorship. As
far as France was concerned, the persistency of the Church
proved too strong to be offset by the friendly interest and
rather vacillating liberalism of the Crown, and the ecclesiastical
control of the printing-press became, before 1540,
an established and an obstructive fact. One of the results
of the antagonism of the Church to critical scholarship
was to drive into the ranks of sympathisers with the Reformers,
if not into Protestantism itself, very many of the
scholars who were not at the outset Reformers and who
were not keenly interested in the theological issues of the
period, but who were naturally indignant at the reiterated
interference, often on the part of very ignorant men, with
scholarly undertakings. The men engaged in preparing
for the public critical editions of the world’s literature,
asked to be let alone, but they asked in vain.</p>

<p>It was under such conditions of strife and disturbance,
of contests political and religious, of wars civil and foreign,
of revolts against the Church, and of fresh assumptions on
the part of the Church against any liberty of action for
the community or for the individual, that the life-work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Robert Estienne was begun. He was born in 1503, and
appears to have imbibed his scholarly interests and to
have secured his early scholarly training principally from
the learned men who had served as correctors of the press
for his father, Henry. Henry died in 1520, and his widow
married, in 1522, Simon de Colines, whose work as a
typographer has already been referred to. Robert
speedily became the assistant of his step-father, and the
first important undertaking entrusted to him was the
supervision through the press of an edition of the <i>Novum
Testamentum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The text followed the version of the
Vulgate, but the youthful editor found occasion for certain
corrections. The textual changes ventured upon in
the volume at once called forth criticism from the divines
of the Sorbonne, who were already raising objections to
any general dissemination of the Scriptures, and Robert
found himself classed with the group of heretical persons
who required watching. This reputation clung to him
through all his career, and the hostility of the divines,
thus early aroused, was never withdrawn. According to
Robert’s correspondence, he held himself always ready to
justify on critical grounds and by theological arguments
the corrections in the Vulgate text upon which he had
ventured. The divines, however, while continuing their
invectives from their instructors’ Chairs and even from
the pulpit, took pains to avoid any direct controversy on
the points at issue.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1525, appeared the first work published with the individual
imprint of Robert, an edition of the <i>Apuleii
Liber de Deo Socratis</i>, which was followed in 1526 by the
<i>Ciceronis Epistolæ</i>, without which hardly any publishing
list of the time could be begun. Robert adopted as his
device a spreading olive tree, with one or more branches
broken off, and the motto <i>Noli altum sapere, sed time</i>.
This appears to be based upon the words in <i>Romans</i> xi.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>

20, “Be not high-minded, but fear.” Robert’s career was,
however, in a sense, a contradiction of his motto. He
was high-minded, and he refused to fear, or at least to be
fearful. Shortly after his majority, Robert married Petronilla,
a daughter of the famous publisher Jodocus Badius,
and the co-operation of his wife proved of no little service
in the management of the editorial portion of his business,
as she was herself a thorough scholar, and could read,
write, and speak Latin fluently. The publisher’s household
included for many years, in addition to the members
of his family circle, a number of his editors and press-correctors.
These assistants represented a number of
nationalities, and they had, as a convenience, adopted
Latin as their common tongue. Through the example of
these permanent guests, aided by the facility of the mistress
of the house, Latin became the language first of the
table and finally of the whole domestic establishment,
even the servants and children having gained a sufficient
mastery of the idioms. Maittaire mentions that it was a
custom of Robert Estienne to hang up in the streets or in
the precincts of the University proof-sheets of important
works which were passing through his Press, and to offer
a reward for every error that might be discovered.</p>

<p>The following list of works, selected from among the
more important of the publications issued by the second
Estienne during the succeeding fifteen years, will serve
to give an impression of the character of his undertakings.
For the titles in this list I am indebted to Greswell.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<ul><li class="ifrst">1528. Linacer, Thomas, “De Emendata Latini Sermonis Structura,”
quarto. Robert printed two later editions in octavo. Linacer was a learned
Englishman, physician and ecclesiastic, and a correspondent of Erasmus,
through whom probably he became known to Estienne. His death occurred
in 1524, and this Paris edition of his most important work could, therefore,
not have had the advantage of the author’s supervision. “Justiniani Institutiones,”
and “Digestorum seu Pandectarum volumina quinque Biblia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>utriusque Testamenti Latina, ex veteribus MSS. exemplaribus emendata,
fol. cal. Mart.” This was Robert’s first impression of the complete Bible.
For its preparation he had made a very comprehensive collation of the existing
manuscripts of the Vulgate with the texts heretofore printed.</li>

<li class="ifrst"> “Dictionarium seu Latinæ Linguæ Thesaurus.” This work was not completed
in 1528, but during this year and the two years following, its preparation
was in progress. Robert’s part in the undertaking was by no means
restricted to the planning, the printing, and the publishing. Not having
succeeded in securing the services of a competent editor, he finally decided
himself to attempt the task of the compilation and the editing. Having
secured from scholarly friends a favourable opinion on the first few sheets
prepared for the press, he was encouraged to persevere, and applied himself
to the task day and night for more than two years, during which he had
also on his hands the responsibilities of his printing and publishing business.
The work was adopted at once by the University of Paris, and, superseding
the existing Latin dictionaries (of which the “Cornucopia” of Aldus Manutius,
issued in 1513, was perhaps the most important), it remained for many years
the standard authority on its subject, as well as a monument to the learning
and industry of a representative publisher.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1529. “Plinii Epistolæ, Panegyricus de Viris Illustribus, Suetonius de
Claris Grammaticis,” and “Terentii Opera.” In this last, Robert, with great
trouble, restored the Greek passages cited by Donatus. In all preceding
editions, blanks appeared where these Greek citations should have been
inserted. The publisher claimed that he had also been able, by collation
of the best MSS., to correct no less than 6000 errors that had found their
way into texts previously accepted. Between the years 1529 and 1551,
Robert printed of “Terence” no less than eleven editions.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1530. “Plauti Opera,” in folio, and “Rhetores Latini.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1531. The first edition of the previously referred to “Dictionary of the
Latin Language” bears date this year; it is printed in folio. In the course
of twelve years, two later and revised editions were issued. The general
acceptance of the Dictionary as the best work on its subject made it an
object for the rapacity of a number of unscrupulous reprinters, and various
unauthorised reprints appeared, some of which were seriously incorrect or
incomplete. Estienne appears to have accepted with philosophy the inevitable
injury to his business interests, but complained bitterly at the loss to
his repute as a scholar, caused by foisting upon the public, over his name,
slovenly and inaccurate work.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1532. “Virgilii Opera cum Commentariis Servii Valeriani Castigationibus”,
in folio. A second impression of the Scriptures, entitled “Biblia.” “Breves
in eadem Annotationes ex Doctiss. Interpretationibus et Hebræorum Commentariis,
etc., cum Priv. Regis.” This was magnificently printed in a handsome
folio, with brief notes or <i>apostilles</i> on the margin. Notwithstanding
Robert’s care in fortifying himself with the royal privilege, and with a
license from the University censors (who for theological works were at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
time appointed by the Sorbonne), the divines of the college renewed their
warfare against him on the ground that he had dared to print the Scriptures
at all. From the severest effects of this <i>odium theologicum</i> Robert was preserved
through the personal influence of King Francis. He was obliged,
however, to engage to print nothing further, presumably nothing of a doctrinal
character, <i>nisi cum bona eorum gratia</i>.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1533. “<span class ="err" title="original: Virgillii">Virgilii</span> Opera.” 8vo. (Again.)</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Horatii ars poetica.” 4to.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Plinii epistolæ.” (Again.) The edition of 1529 had apparently lasted
for four years.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1534. Robert again hazarded the wrath of the divines by a third edition
of the “Biblia,” for which the demand had evidently continued. This time
he escaped without interference.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1535. “Budæi Annotationes in Pandecta” and “Budæi de transitu Hellenismi

<li class="ifrst">1538. “Dictionarium Latino-Gallicum.” Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Dictionnaire François-Latin.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Ciceronis Epistolæ.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1539. “Ciceronis Opera Omnia,” two volumes, octavo, probably the
most beautiful edition of this oft printed author which had yet appeared.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1540. This year was marked by the appearance of a fourth impression of
the Latin Scriptures. This presented some considerable modifications from
the plan of the previous issues. It gave the Vulgate text, but with new
and important elucidations, and it gave further, for comparison with the
text, various readings based upon the Hebrew and Greek. The title is
elaborate: “Biblia, Hebræa, Chaldæa, Græca et Latina, nomina virorum,
mulierum, populorum, idolorum, urbium, fluviorum, montium cæterorumque
locorum, quæ in ipsis Bibliis leguntur, restituta, cum Latina interpretatione
et ipsorum locorum descriptione ex Cosmographis. His accesserunt
schemata Tabernaculi Mosaici et Templi Solomonis, quæ præunte Francisco
Vatablo, Hebraicarum literarum Regio professore doctissimo, summa
arte et fide expressa sunt.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Parisiis ex officina Roberti Stephani, Typographi Regii, MDXL. cum
privilegio Regis.” Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">This is the first publication of Robert’s containing the specification of his
title as “Printer to the King.” His acknowledged erudition and the importance
of the scholarly undertakings carried on by him had long before
attracted the attention and the favour of Francis, and in 1539, in the thirty-sixth
year of the typographer’s age, the King conferred upon him the honourable
distinction of <i>Imprimeur Royal</i> for works in Hebrew and Latin.
After June, 1539, Robert styles himself <i>Regius Typographus</i> or <i>Librarius</i>,
or <i>Regius Hebraicarum et Latinarum Literarum Typographus</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1540, on the death of Neobarius, the first who had
received the title of “Printer in Greek to the King,” this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
distinction also was conferred upon Estienne. The
official recognition and approval given by the Crown to
his undertakings could not, however, save these from the
censure and indignant opposition of the divines, and they
did what they could to check and to discourage his publications.
Robert was brought into special jeopardy and
trouble through an impression of the Decalogue executed
(in 1540) in large characters, and printed in the form of a
hanging map for affixing to the walls of chambers and
school-rooms. Such an undertaking seems to our present
understanding innocent enough, whether considered from
a Romanist or from a Protestant point of view, but in this
publication of the Ten Commandments, the divines appear
to have discovered little less mischief than in all the
heresies of Luther.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Robert relates that the orthodox
censors caused a counter impression of the Decalogue to
be prepared by one Johannes Andreas, in which the first
two commandments were combined into one, omitting
the prohibition of making and worshipping images, and
the tenth commandment was divided into two in order
to make up the denary number.</p>

<p>During this year, Estienne goes on to say, there were
instituted against him on the part of the Sorbonne, various
rigorous proceedings. His house was frequently searched
for heretical works, and in order to avoid being arrested,
he was not infrequently compelled to absent himself from
home and to betake himself for safety to the King’s
Court. This description of a publisher taking refuge at
Court in order to protect himself against the violence of
officials who were (at least nominally) the King’s censors,
throws a curious light on both the strength and the weakness
of the Crown. With all the authority of the kingdom
at his command, Francis was evidently unable to
put any restriction upon the operations of the ecclesiastical
censors, who in their dogmatic and unruly zeal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>were doing what was in their power to throw the influence
of the University against the literary development of
France and of Europe. On the other hand, the Doctors of
the Sorbonne, although backed by the authority of Rome,
were not strong enough, at least for a number of years,
to put a stop to the publication in Catholic Paris of works
stigmatised by them as dangerously heretical.</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">In 1541, undismayed by the dissatisfaction and continued threats of the
Sorbonne, Robert put forth a Latin Pentateuch, entitled “Libri Moysi
quinque cum annotationibus,” etc., in folio, and as a companion volume, a
“Novum Testamentum Latine, cum brevibus annotationibus,” in octavo.
This last was sharply attacked on the ground that the editor (in this case the
publisher himself) had expressed himself objectionably on the subjects of
purgatory and confession.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1542. He published, as a companion to his “Cicero,” an edition in
quarto of “Quintiliani Institutiones Oratoriæ.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1543. Appeared a new impression of the entire works of “Cicero,” the
demand for whose writings appeared to be steadily increasing.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1544. Editions were printed in octavo of a number of the Latin historians,
including “Sallust” and “Suetonius.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1545. The completion of the quarto edition of the Hebrew Scriptures,
issued in twenty-four parts, which Maittaire describes as a magnificent work.</li>

<li class="ifrst">In this year appeared also, printed in folio, the magnificent series of the
Greek ecclesiastical writers, the Greek texts in which were printed with the
royal Greek characters recently cast under instructions from the King. The
series bears the title “Ecclesiastica Historia Eusebii, Socratis, Theodoriti,
Theodori, Sozomeni, Evagrii, Græce.” To the “Historia” Robert prefixed
a Greek epistle, in which, with what Maittaire calls Attic eloquence, he has
celebrated the praises of Francis I., extolling at once the munificence of
the King and the discriminating support given by him to the highest
literary undertakings.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Eusebii Pamphili Evangelicæ Demonstrationes, Libri X., Græce.”
Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Moschopuli de Ratione Examinandæ Orationis Libellus, Græce.” 4to.
This was a grammatical work for the instruction of youth, now first printed.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Impressions of “Juvenal, Persius, Valerius Maximus, Lucian, and
Terence.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">A fifth impression of the complete “Biblia Latina,” for the fourth impression
of which sale had evidently been found notwithstanding the denunciations
of the Church authorities. Robert had for five years been making
preparation for this edition by the collection both of printed texts and of
MSS. For the notes, use had been made of the material of Erasmus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Gualtherus, and particularly of Vatablus, the learned Professor of Hebrew in
the <i>Collége Royal</i>. The citations from the latter had been collected by diligent
students who had attended the Professor’s lectures. The captious
divines, finding the notes sanctioned by such an authority, did not at first
venture to cavil at this edition. Later, however, they threatened Robert
with various pains and penalties because he had omitted to procure for the
work their license. They contended that the title of “Printer to the
King” did not exempt him from a compliance with the regulations prescribed
by the University. This claim on the part of the University, that
the approval of its own representatives must be secured even for works
issued under the direct authority of the Crown, was throughout the following
century a frequent cause of contention. It appears never to have been
formally adjusted. The charge was made at the time that the <i>scholia</i> or
<i>annotationes</i> complained of were really the work not of Vatablus, but of
Robert himself. Such an accusation does credit to the publisher’s scholarship
if not to his truthfulness, but there is no evidence to support it.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1546. “Biblia Hebræa,” 16mo, or <i>forma minima</i>, issued in eight volumes.
Le Long speaks of the correctness and extreme beauty of this edition.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></li>

<li class="ifrst">A sixth edition of the Latin Bible, with a text more pure and more accurate
than had been secured in any of the previous issues. This was the second
of Robert’s Latin Bibles which escaped censure.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1546. The first and only publication from his press in Italian, which is
ranked as one of the most interesting literary curiosities bearing his imprint,
“La Coltivatione di Luigi Alamanni, al Christianissimo Re Francesco primo,
con privilegi.” 4to. This is the first edition of what Greswell calls the
georgical poem of Alamanni. The character is a bold italic, and the volume
is a beautiful piece of book-making. The author was a Florentine poet,
banished from his native country, who had found refuge at the Court of
Francis. He is one of the very few contemporary writers who secured the
advantage of Robert’s imprint.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1547. “Dionysii Halicarnassei Antiquitatum Romanarum, Libri X.,
Græce,” which Fabricius calls one of the most beautiful books produced
by the Greek Press.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Ciceronis Epistolæ.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">In this year (which witnessed the death of King Francis), Robert had occasion
to publish various monographs presenting the funeral sermons, and
describing the obsequies.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1548. “Alexandri Tralliani Medici, Libri XII., Græce;” and “Rhazæ
de Pestilentia Libellus ex Syrorum lingua in Græcam translatus.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Dionis Romanarum Historiarum, Libri XXIII., Græce.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1549. “Hebraicarum Institutionum, Libri IV. Pagnino auctore.”

<li class="ifrst">“Virgilii Opera.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Horatii poemata, scholiis et argumentis ab H. Stephano illustrata.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Novum Testamentum, Græce.” This edition was described by Colomesius
as not containing a single error, but the industrious Greswell finds in
the preface itself <i>pulres</i> for <i>plures</i>.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1550. “Novum Testamentum, Græce,” in folio, with Robert’s own “Præfatio
Græce et Latine scripta et annotationes,” Greek Tabulæ, and biographical
notices of the writers of the Gospels and of St. Paul. To the Epistles
are prefixed arguments and introductions from various writers, and in all
the books marginal readings are given. The work also includes what Maittaire
calls an extensive copy of Greek hexameters, composed by Henry
Estienne (the second), the eldest son of Robert, who was at the time barely
twenty-one years of age. This magnificent edition was long accepted as a
most important authority on New Testament text, and critics like Gibbon,
and scholars like Porson, have held this book and its publisher (who was
also its editor) chiefly responsible for the perpetration of the interpolation
of the famous verse in John i., 5, 7, on the heavenly witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
record, however, of the long contests between the critics and the theologians,
concerning this verse (now generally admitted to be an interpolation) and
other similar textual issues, is foreign to my subject. It may, I think,
fairly be assumed that in this instance, as in all editorial work, Robert acted
honestly enough, following the best information and the most trustworthy
authorities within his reach. The matter of the long contests with the
Sorbonne brought about by this critical edition of the Testament, will be
referred to a little later. I will here, for the convenience of reference, complete
the list of selections from Robert’s list of publications:</li>

<li class="ifrst">1551. “Justini Philosophi et Martyris Opera, Græce.” Folio. Chevillier
considers this the most excellent of the Greek impressions of the Estiennes.
He contends that, “whether for the accuracy of the text, the superlative
beauty of the characters, the excellence of the paper, or the evenness of the
impressions, the work of Robert Estienne bore away the palm not only from
the other typographers of Paris, but also from the most skilled printers in
other countries.” “Robert,” he says, “raised the art to the summit of
perfection.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></li>

<li class="ifrst">“Rudimenta fidei Christianæ, Græce, nunc primum in lucem edita.” Maittaire
(“Vita Stephani”) explains that this is Calvin’s Catechism translated
into Greek by the printer’s son Henry. The omission of any reference to
Calvin was doubtless due to the desire to avoid arousing fresh indignation
at the Sorbonne. It is difficult to understand, however, how a volume of
this character could in any case have escaped the vigilance of the censors.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Novum Testamentum, Græce, cum duplici interpretatione Erasmi et
veteris interpretis,” etc. Yet another impression of the volume which had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>already brought upon the publisher the censorship and antagonism of the
jealous divines. It contained a few changes from the text of the earlier
issues, but the principal peculiarity of the edition is the fact that the text
appears for the first time divided into verses, <i>versiculi</i>.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Sententiæ Veterum Poetarum per G. Majorem in locos communes
digestæ. Antonii Mancinelli de Poetica virtute libellus. Index sententiarum,”
etc. 8vo.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Commentarius puerorum de quotidiano sermone, Maturino Corderio,
auctore.” 8vo. Cordier was one of the small group of contemporary authors
with whose work Robert’s imprint is associated. He was a schoolmaster of
Paris, but having adopted the reformed faith, he withdrew to Geneva.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Dionis Nicæi Rerum Romanarum Epitome, Græce, auctore Joan. Xiphilino;
ex Bibl. regia, ac. off. R. Stephani, Typogr. regii, regiis typis.” 4to.
“Eadem Latine, Gulielmo Blanco Albiensi interprete.” 4to.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>Epitome Dionis</i> is the last work printed by Robert
in Paris prior to his removal to Geneva. Before giving
the titles of the more important issues of his Press in
Geneva, it is desirable to go back in the narrative for a
few years, and in outlining some of the events in the long
contest between the private publisher and the divines of
the Sorbonne, to indicate some of the causes which
brought about the transfer of the great publishing establishment
from Paris, at that time the most noteworthy
and possibly the greatest city in Europe, to the quiet
little town on Lake Geneva.</p>

<p>We have seen that the work of the enterprising and
scholarly publisher was regarded with intelligent and appreciative
interest by King Francis I., and that while the
King had in various ways furthered the undertakings of
Estienne, his most important service had been rendered
in utilising the royal influence to protect the printer
against the divines of the Sorbonne. The title of “Printer
to the King,” while fully deserved, of course, on other
grounds, was given to Robert with the special purpose of
securing for him an additional safeguard against the assaults
of the theological censors. These theological censors
were irate at the assumption by the publisher, acting
as his own editor, of the right to correct the text of Scripture,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and to add marginal commentaries, while they were
also indignant at what they considered an unwarrantable
interference on the part of the King with the old-time
right of the Theological Faculty of the University to exercise
a censorship control over all theological and religious
publications emanating from the French Press.</p>

<p>The interest of Francis in scholarship and the influence
of Budæus and other scholars led him to initiate or to
accept the scheme of a Royal College, to be devoted
more particularly to instruction in the ancient languages.
It was a part of the plan that Erasmus should be called
from his peaceful retreat in the house of his friend Froben,
the publisher of Basel, to the headship of the new college.
The Emperor (Charles V.) put an end to the negotiation,
however, by forbidding Erasmus to leave the territory of
the empire, and by threatening him, in the event of his
disobedience, with the stoppage of his pension. It is interesting
to think of the most Catholic Emperor on the
one hand, and the “eldest son of the Church” on the
other, contending for the services of the scholar whose writings
had been condemned in Rome as heretical, and were
prohibited in Spain, and who could not at this time obtain
from the Paris University a printing privilege. The college
failed to secure Erasmus, and failed also, at least
during the lifetime of Francis, to secure the buildings that
the King had planned for it, but its professorships were
finally endowed in 1539. The authorities of the University
were, with hardly an exception, bitterly opposed to
the new foundation, and the considerations they presented
against the plan were substantially the same as those
which were from year to year being urged by the same
group of divines against the printing and the distribution
of “pagan,” <i>i. e.</i> classic, literature, and of works undertaking
to criticise and to correct texts which had been
accepted and approved by the Church. The argument
of the University against the new college was presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
before the Parliament of Paris (that is to say, the High
Court of the capital) by M. Gaillard. He urged that “to
propagate the knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew languages
would operate to the absolute destruction of all
religion.” “Were these professors theologians,” he asked,
“that they should pretend to explain the Bible? Were
not indeed the very Bibles of which they made use in
large printed in Germany, the region of heresy? Or at
least were they not indebted for them to the Jews?”
The new professors made their rejoinder through Marillac,
whose arguments covered, it will be noted, the points
raised by Estienne in defence of his annotated editions of
the Scriptures. “We make no pretensions,” said the
professors, “to the name or the function of theologians.
It is as philologists or grammarians only that we undertake
to explain the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures. If
you, who are criticising our teachings, possess any knowledge
of Greek and Hebrew, you are at liberty to attend
our lectures and, if you find any heresy in our instruction,
to denounce us. If, however, you are yet ignorant of
both Greek and Hebrew, on what grounds can you base
your fitness as censors or your claims to forbid us to
teach in these tongues? In teaching Greek, it is for us
to decide what literature is best suited for our purpose.
In teaching Hebrew, if, for various reasons, we find the
Hebrew Scriptures best adapted for our classes, what
right have you to complain? What other Hebrew book,
indeed, would you select for us?” It is to be borne in
mind that for the texts used for these lectures, the professors
of the <i>Collége Royal</i> were largely dependent upon
the presses of Estienne, and that in defending their right
to teach Greek and Hebrew, they were also contending
for his right to print and to sell the books required.</p>

<p>Impressed by these reasonings, and influenced also, of
course, by the authority of the King, who had accepted
for himself the responsibility for the scheme of instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
in his new college, the Parliament studiously avoided any
decision in the controversy. This was, under the circumstances,
a substantial victory for the defendants, and the
<i>Collége Royal</i> not only maintained its ground, but continued
to increase in importance and in influence.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Maittaire quotes, in this connection, the testimony of
Conrad Heresbach, a learned jurisconsult, who says that
(in 1540) he heard a monk speaking thus from the pulpit:
“A new language has been discovered which they call
Greek. Against this you must be carefully on your
guard, for it is the infant tongue of all heresies. There is
a book written in that language called the New Testament.
It is <i>un livre plein de ronces et de vipères</i>. As to the Hebrew
tongue, it is well known that all who learn it
presently become Jews.”</p>

<p>In the edition of <i>Horace</i> prepared by Lambinus, the
editor says, in the epistle dedicatory addressed to Charles
IX.: “The University of Paris was then [in the time of
Francis] equally destitute of sound philosophy and of
elegant learning. The poets, historians, and philosophers
of ancient Greece were scarcely known by name, and
... scarcely a single professor was acquainted with
even the rudiments of Greek or Hebrew, or was capable
of teaching Latin in its genuine purity.” Erasmus writes,
in 1529, to some friends in the <i>Collége Royal</i>, encouraging
them to persevere in their efforts to raise the standard of
liberal scholarship in France, and referring to the progress
of the College of Louvain, which had recently been instituted
through the munificence of Busleiden, a simple
canon of Brussels, and for the general organisation of
which Erasmus was largely responsible. The original
purpose of the college (which became, in the next century,
a headquarters for Catholic theology) was the prosecution
of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.</p>

<p>It was in connection with the <i>Collége Royal</i>, and as, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>fact, an essential part of his great scheme for the development
of higher education, that King Francis instituted the
<i>Imprimerie Royale</i>, with its appendage of <i>Typographus
Regius</i>, an arrangement which was at the time unprecedented
in the annals of literature. “By an apparatus
which nothing less than princely munificence could have
provided,” says Greswell, “the admirable productions of
classic genius and taste, and particularly those of Greece,
were now to be given to the public with a beauty of characters
and an exquisiteness of technical perfection to
which no typographer had ever yet attained or even in
imagination aspired.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The fonts of Greek type which came later to be known
as <i>Characteres Regii</i>, were cast under the direction of
Claude Garamond, from designs furnished by Angelus
Vergetius, of Candia, whose Greek penmanship was so
singularly beautiful as to have been selected as the pattern
for Garamond to follow. Vergetius was appointed by the
King to a post in the new college, as the King’s <i>Escrivain
en Grecque</i>, with a stipend equal to that of the professors.</p>

<p>As has already been noted, the distinction of <i>Regius in
Græcis Typographus</i>, was first conferred on Neobarius,
who received an annual stipend of one hundred gold
crowns. Neobarius died before the organisation of the
<i>Imprimerie</i> was completed, and the first of the King’s
printers to assume the direction of the royal establishment
and to make use of the new Greek fonts was Robert
Estienne, who, both by technical knowledge as a printer
and by his attainments as a scholar, was exceptionally
fitted to carry out the large schemes the King had in
mind, and who, in fact, was only too eager to supplement
these with still larger schemes of his own. It was equally
fortunate that the most enterprising and most scholarly
printer-publisher in Europe should have been able to
secure the all important co-operation of the resources and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>influence of an enlightened and ambitious monarch, and
that the King should have had at hand for the first direction
of his novel undertaking, a man possessing for the
task such exceptional qualifications. Francis was the
only ruler of the time in Europe who gave any important
co-operation to the encouragement of literature and to
the development of the still new art of printing and book-making,
and, as far as intelligent literary interest is concerned,
we must, to find any such distinctive service on
the part of a monarch, go back to Ptolemy Philadelphus,
in the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Francis had a personal interest
also in the process of printing, and took pleasure in
inspecting from time to time the work in his <i>Imprimerie</i>.
Maittaire relates that, calling one day at the <i>officina</i> of
Estienne, the King found Robert engaged in correcting
a proof, and would not permit the printer to interrupt
his work, but waited until this was finished.</p>

<p>It was Francis who instituted the office of Librarian to
the King, <i>Bibliothécaire du Roy</i>, a post which was first
held by the great scholar Budæus. In connection with
the great development in the art of printing which took
place during his reign and of which a full measure of the
credit must be ascribed to the King, there arose a large
interest in artistic bindings. The fashion of a taste for
books set by the King was naturally taken up by many
of the noblemen, who began to form libraries of handsomely
printed and choicely bound books. One of the
most zealous collectors of the time was Grolier de Servier,
Vicomte d’Aguisy, who was for some years Ambassador
of France at the Court of Rome. His library was said to
have contained no less than three thousand volumes, an
enormous collection for the sixteenth century, and the
greater portion of these were elaborately and tastefully
bound. The name of Grolier has ever since been held in
honour by admirers of artistic book-making, and, in connection
with the establishment in New York of a Grolier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Club of book-collectors, is assured of preservation in appreciative
memory.</p>

<p>In 1546, the continued antagonism of the Sorbonne to
the publishing undertakings of Estienne, brought the
divines into direct conflict with the authority of the King.
In presenting to the King this year a copy of his fine
edition of <i>Eusebius</i>, Robert wrote to Du Chastel, Bishop
of Mascon, complaining that the divines were privately
soliciting an interdict of the latest issue of his annotated
Bible, and declared his willingness to submit the work,
together with the censure of the Faculty, to any competent
theologians whom the King might select. The King
found this proposal satisfactory, and instructed the Bishop
to transmit his royal mandate to the Doctors of the Sorbonne
to institute an examination of Robert’s Bible, to
prepare a list of the alleged errors, and to submit this list
to him. They promised compliance, but, in spite of a
second mandate, no such list was prepared. It is probable
that they did not possess the requisite scholarship for
the purpose, while it is also evident that what they
objected to was not an incidental error, but the whole
spirit and character of the undertaking. In the meantime,
they induced the theologians of Louvain to procure
the insertion of Robert’s Bible in an <i>index expurgatorius</i>
which was at that time in preparation in Louvain. Du
Chastel was directed to address a third injunction to the
divines, and the King forbade the printing (at least in
France) of the catalogue of Louvain. Finally, the Faculty
submitted a list of fifteen passages which they claimed to
contain dangerous heresies. The King ordered these to
be examined by the Bishop of Mascon and the Chancellor
of the University, whose report was favourable to Robert,
and who pointed out that the divines had not properly
understood either the text or the notes. The King issued
a Brief with the royal seal affixed, ordering the divines to
complete their list of <i>censuræ</i>, or to withdraw their strictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
upon the book, strictures which, for a work of this
character, naturally interfered with the sale. The
divines persisted in their contumacy, while Robert, trusting
in the support of the King, went on with the printing
and sale of his Bibles. In March, 1547, King Francis
died. His death was a serious misfortune not only to
Estienne but to the cause of liberal scholarship and literary
production in France.</p>

<p>Francis was at the time of his death in his fifty-third
year and had reigned for nearly thirty-three years. As
before pointed out, no other monarch of Europe had
done so much for scholarly literature. In Italy, valuable
co-operation was given by certain of the princes and individual
noblemen, while in Germany, the earlier printer-publishers
were dependent rather upon the scholarly men
of the middle classes and upon wealthy towns-people than
upon princes or nobles. The same year, 1547, saw the
death of Henry VIII. (who will in our memories always
be associated with Francis on account of the famous
meeting on the Field of the Cloth of Gold), of Vatablus,
the learned Paris professor of Greek, and of Beatus
Rhenanus, scholar, humanist, and friend of Erasmus
and Froben. Luther, whose life-work had, in addition to
the great results usually connected with it, exercised such
a wide-spread influence on the production and distribution
of literature, had passed away the year preceding.</p>

<p>Du Verdier (himself a Catholic) expresses the opinion
“that the Lutheran heresy, and the controversies to
which it gave rise, conspired greatly to the development
of literature.” The advocates of the Reformation showed
themselves to be persons of great intellectual ability and
profound research in sacred and classical literature, of
which they made in their writings a great use. The
severe ridicule that they brought upon the ignorance and
barbarism of their opponents finally aroused the Catholic
doctors to similar scholarly researches, and to call in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
aid of erudition, which they had previously imagined to
be some species of heresy.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The famous Marguerite de Valois, sister of King Francis,
was prominent both as an authoress and as a protectress
of literature, and her influence was always ready
in behalf of the undertakings of Estienne. Pierre du
Chastel, who had been an instructor of Marguerite, and
who was one of the few Greek scholars of the kingdom,
was also a serviceable friend to Estienne. Du Chastel
had succeeded in securing a patron for the unfortunate
Dolet after his first heretical offences (an interposition
which brought upon Du Chastel himself the suspicion of
the orthodox), and he had also obtained from the King a
pardon for the Waldenses. In neither case did it prove
possible to secure a lasting protection. Dolet was burned
a few years later, while the persecution of the Waldenses
was also renewed with fresh bitterness after the death of
Francis. Dolet was a scholar who, having studied jurisprudence
and, later, served as instructor, finally became a
printer. He devoted himself particularly to the study
of the writings of Cicero, and published a <i>Commentaria
Linguæ Latinæ</i> and also the <i>Formulæ Latinarum locutionum
illustriorum</i>. Niceron says that he was the author of not
less than twenty-four separate works. He was imprisoned
on various occasions for his freedom of speech on religious
subjects, and was finally burned as a heretic in 1546.
His heresy was evidently not of the kind to secure the
sympathy of Calvin, who referred to him as an “impious
wretch.”</p>

<p>Henry II., who, in 1547, succeeded to the throne of
France, while not possessing the distinctive interest in
literature which had characterised his father Francis, was,
nevertheless, at least at the outset, favourably disposed
towards the men of letters with whom Francis had come
into personal relations, and he was prepared to carry out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>the engagements into which his father had entered concerning
the printing-office and type-foundry. He also
took up the issue that had been raised between his father
and the divines of the Sorbonne. In the first year of his
reign, he commanded the divines forthwith to complete
their list of <i>censuræ</i>, and threatened, in the event of further
contumacy, severe measures for their chastisement.
This produced an engagement on their part that by the
following All Saints’ Day should finally be made public
the long-promised schedules of all the errors and heresies
discovered by them in the several Bibles of Robert Estienne.
On the day specified, however, in place of the
promised <i>censuræ</i>, the divines presented simply a fresh
petition that the sale of the Bibles might be interdicted,
on the general ground that their editor was a sacramentarian,
and that he had spoken of the souls of men as
mortal. The petition received no attention, and after
some months’ further delay, ten divines presented themselves
at the palace at Fontainebleau, with a list of forty-five
objectionable articles or passages. The presentation
was made before the King’s Council, with which were
sitting several cardinals and bishops. The printer was
heard in his own defence, and the matter was then taken
into consideration by the Council. The prelates decided
that in forty of the passages specified there was no just
ground for criticism. The remaining five were liable to
objection, but might be satisfactorily explained. The contending
parties were then recalled before the Council, and
the divines were rebuked for their groundless interference,
and were forbidden to arrogate to themselves in future
the <i>jus censorium</i>, which was declared to belong to the
bishop only. Enraged and disappointed, the deputies
returned to Paris, and there, by some special management,
they succeeded in procuring an order for a temporary
suspension of the sale of Robert’s Bibles. Later,
as a result, apparently, of some vacillation on the part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the King, they secured also a royal mandate that the case
should be submitted for the examination of certain judges
whose office it was to take cognisance of matters of heresy.
After an anxious contest extending over eight months,
Robert finally succeeded in securing a counter mandate
cancelling the foregoing order, and confining the jurisdiction
of the affair to the Privy Council. This served to
protect him for a brief period.</p>

<p>I have given the account of this contest with some
detail because it was the first case in France that had
come to a formal trial, in which publications were charged
with heresy, and because also the animus shown by the
ecclesiastics of the Sorbonne emphasised the divergence
of the University from the interests of literature and of
critical scholarship, and foreshadowed the transfer of literary
and publishing activity from Paris to Switzerland,
Germany, and the Low Countries. In 1548, King Henry
was intent on passing the Alps, and began his expedition
from Troyes. The absence of the Court, and the necessity,
in connection with his contest with the Sorbonne, of
pursuing its movements, gave occasion to Robert to visit
Lyons, and in this journey he is supposed to have performed
the task of subdividing into verses the chapters of
the New Testament. A great part of this labour he is
said to have performed on horseback.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The invention, if
it may be so described, proved a convenience and found
general acceptation, and has been followed in all later
editions of the Testament.</p>

<p>In the same year, the divines completed a second series
of one hundred and seven “articles” or charges of heresy
against Robert’s Bibles, and through the influence of the
King’s confessor, the vacillating monarch was induced to
issue a new mandate prohibiting the sale of the Bibles.
Robert now declared to his friend Du Chastel his intention
of abandoning his native country, and the King,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>persuaded by the Bishop that this would be a serious
misfortune for France, finally, after a delay of some
months, issued a new <i>brevet</i> of protection for his printer.
In 1550, fresh attempts were made by the divines to
secure the complete suppression of the Bibles, the sales
of which had of necessity already been materially interfered
with. On this occasion, Du Chastel, who was looking
forward to a cardinal’s hat, finally abandoned his
advocacy of Estienne. Robert secured an interview with
the divines, and presenting a copy of the latest issue of
the New Testament complained of, he requested, as before,
a specific statement of the charges. The two divines
who acted as spokesmen, were, according to Robert’s report,
evidently ignorant of Greek. They demanded, however,
that the original “copy” or manuscript should be
placed before them. He replied that the original was
not one manuscript only, but fifteen, the several texts of
which had been with great diligence collated and the
result printed with all possible fidelity. After some
weeks of further “consideration,” the divines finally gave
their decision, to the effect that this edition of the New
Testament could not be permitted to be sold. Robert
requested that a copy of this decision, together with a
specification of the grounds on which it had been based,
should be presented to the King, but this the divines
refused to do. Robert thereupon presented to the King
a handsomely bound copy of this new impression of the
Testament, and when he had received the royal acknowledgment
of the receipt of this copy, he felt himself to be
sufficiently assured of protection to be able to proceed
with his sales. The divines were indignant that a mere
typographer should presume thus to act in defiance of a
<i>decretum theologicum</i>, but the royal weathercock being for
the moment set fair in the direction of a liberal standard
of Scriptural interpretation, they were helpless to stop
the sales of the book to the general public, although they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
were still able to prevent its acceptance within the precincts
of the University.</p>

<p>While Estienne had thus far been able to secure a successful
result in each one of his several contests with the
Sorbonne, these contests had been for him not only
anxious and troublesome in themselves, but seriously
hampering to his business undertakings. It had also
been made clear to him that the new monarch could not
be depended upon for any such intelligent understanding
of literary and scholarly requirements as had been shown
by King Francis, and that his policy in the control of
the royal Press, or in the assertion of the authority of the
Crown over final censorship of publication, was certain
to vacillate from month to month according to the personal,
political, or ecclesiastical influences that might for
the moment be brought to bear.</p>

<p>It was manifestly impossible to carry on with any
sufficient assurance as to the future a publishing business
involving the planning of large undertakings, unless some
consistent and intelligent policy of censorship could be
depended upon. The enmity of the Sorbonne appeared
to be persistent and irremediable. The irritable suspicions
of the divines concerning the heretical character
of texts printed in Greek could hardly be removed as
long as these divines remained ignorant of Greek. As
Robert was not prepared, under the behests of such
ignorant censorship, to discontinue his scholarly publishing
undertakings, there remained for him no resource but
to abandon Paris, and to transfer his business to some
city where the censorship would be either less rigorous
or more intelligent.</p>

<p>The removal of the business to Geneva took place
early in 1552. The Swiss capital, while at the time a
town of but moderate population, presented certain special
advantages, which could at the time have been found
in no other city out of France, for carrying on a publishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
business of the character of Robert’s. The sharp contests
of the Reformation, turning as they did largely upon intellectual
issues, such as the history of the Church, and the
exegesis of the Scriptures and of the writings of the Fathers,
had developed no little intellectual activity throughout
Europe. Geneva had become the most important
centre for the production of the dogmatic and controversial
literature of the Protestants, or at least of the Calvinists.
Its University, which dated from 1368, and had
been reorganised by Calvin in 1539, was already a place
of resort for students and scholars from all parts of
Europe who were interested in the doctrines of the Reformers,
or who were attracted by the commanding personality
of Calvin, while the Swiss printers had established
channels of distribution for their books not only through
Germany and the Low Countries, but even in far off England.
The distribution in France of the publications
from Geneva, even for books of accepted orthodoxy, was
very much restricted and hampered by the regulations of
the University, which had been framed for the purpose
of keeping the sale of the books in France in the hands
of the French dealers. Heretical works, under which
were classed all the writings of the Protestants, were, of
course, prohibited altogether. It was not possible, however,
through any amount of restriction or prohibition, to
prevent the Geneva printers from making sale of their
works across the easily reached frontiers, and in fact the
forbidden French territory formed a most important part
of their market.</p>

<p>Robert Estienne had not thus far classed himself with
the Protestants, but the persistent and ignorant hostility
shown by the Catholics of the Paris University to his
efforts in behalf of scholarly literature, and the fact that
the principal interest in his undertakings had come from
the liberals and the Reformers, had doubtless had the
effect of bringing him into close sympathy with the Protestants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and particularly with the followers of Calvin. In
1552, at the time of Robert’s arrival in Geneva, Calvin
was probably at the height of his influence. Servetus,
whose medical treatises had been published in Paris,
printed at Vienne, in 1553, his <i>Christianity Restored</i>, the
work which was the more immediate cause of his persecution.
Escaping from the French Inquisition, Servetus
took refuge in Geneva, and there, in the latter part of
1553, was burned at the stake, under the instructions of
Calvin. To a man like Robert Estienne, who was seeking
for a place where the production of good literature
could be carried on freed from the blighting interference
of ecclesiastical bigotry, the death of Servetus may well
have served as a warning that Protestant Geneva was no
more ready than was Catholic Paris to tolerate free speech
or a free press.</p>

<p>Robert had found it necessary, in order to gain time to
prepare for his escape, to temporise with his censors, and
to go through the form of submitting to their authority.
Their indignation when they found that he had given
them the slip was very keen, and according to Beza, the
divines went to the point of burning him in effigy.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> At
the time of Estienne’s arrival in Geneva, Switzerland had
become a place of refuge for Protestant heretics from
various parts of Europe, and the exiles were chiefly attracted
either to Zurich, as the headquarters of the followers
of Zwingli, or to Geneva, as the home of Calvin.
A little later, the groups in those cities from Italy,
France, and South Germany were added to by a number
of divines and scholars from England, whence they had
been driven by the persecution under Queen Mary.
Among the sojourners from Italy were Lelius and Faustus
Socinus (uncle and nephew) from Siena, whose name
afterwards gave a designation to the group of Arians
known as Socinians. The nephew was, later, active in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>diffusing Socinianism in Poland, where, however, it failed
to secure any lasting foundation. The inscription on his
tomb, in Warsaw, is said to read as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Tota jacet Babylon; destruxit tecta Lutherus,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Muros Calvinus: sed fundamenta Socinus.</i><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">One may recall in this connection the description given
by Lowell of that later vigorous Protestant, Theodore
Parker: “He was so ultra-Cinian, he shocked the Socinians.”</p>

<p>There came also from Italy, Bernardus Ochinus, of
Siena, and the more famous Peter Martyr (Vermilius),
from Florence, the latter having, however, more recently
been lecturing in Oxford, where he had been suspended
from his lectureship on the accession of Queen Mary. A
companion to Martyr was John Jewell, also from Oxford,
who, later, became a bishop. Names like the above will
give an impression of the character of the circle in which
Estienne now found himself. It was not only for the
scholar a personal gratification to be thrown into association
with intellectual leaders skilled in critical and theological
learning, but it must also have been of no little
service for the reorganisation of his publishing business
to have at hand a group of advisers and of editors who
would have a keen personal interest in a large proportion
at least of his scholarly undertakings.</p>

<p>The following titles of the more important publications
issued by Robert after the establishment of the Geneva
Press will give an impression of the general direction
taken by his business.</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1552. “Ad Censuras Theologorum Parisiensium, quibus Biblia a Roberto
Stephano Typographo Regio excusa calumniose notarunt, ejusdem Roberti
Stephani Responsio.” The “Response” was also printed in French.</li>

<li class="ifrst">In his “Histoire Critique du Nouveau Testament,” Father Simon, a good
Catholic authority, has entered into a minute examination of the points at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>issue between Robert and his accusers, and his decisions are almost uniformly
in favour of the publisher.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></li>

<li class="ifrst">1553. “La Bible,” in folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Catéchisme,” by Jean Calvin.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“La Forme des Prières Ecclésiastiques.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">With these were a number of other devotional and doctrinal treatises
printed under the immediate direction of Calvin. These treatises, being
planned for popular circulation, were largely printed in French, and the
Geneva list includes, in fact, a much larger proportion of works in the vernacular
than had been issued in Paris.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1554. “In Genesin Commentarius Calvini.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Exposition Continuelle sur les Evangiles.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Ambrosii Calepini Dictionarium.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Defensio Orthodoxæ Fidei de Sacra Trinitate, contra prodigiosos errores
Michælis Serveti Hispani, ubi ostenditur hæreticos jure gladii
cœrcendos esse, et nominatim de homine hoc tam impio justi et merito
sumptum Genevæ fuisse Supplicium, per Johannem Calvinum.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“De Hæreticis a Civili Magistratu puniendis Libellus, Theodori Bezæ.”</li>
</ul>

<p>It is somewhat to be wondered at that Robert, fresh
from harassing persecution in Paris, should have been
willing to place his imprint upon this argument of Calvin
as to the rightfulness of the punishment of Servetus, and
upon the companion treatise which the zeal of Beza had
prompted him to compose in defence of the right of the
civil magistrate to punish heretics. Assuming that by
this time Estienne had thrown in his lot entirely with the
Calvinists, it is nevertheless to be borne in mind that the
record and the utterances of the man had heretofore
shown him to be a consistent advocate of intellectual
liberty. Even after his sojourn in Geneva, there is on
record no utterance of Robert’s which is not in accord
with this view of his own personal predilections. Robert
had, moreover, always taken such high ground as to publishing
responsibility, that he cannot escape being held
accountable for the approval implied in the association of
his imprint with these zealous defences of an act that
must always remain a serious blot on the history of
Protestantism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>
<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1555. “Concordantiæ Bibliorum utriusque Testamenti.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Calvinus in Acta Apostolorum.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1556-57. “Commentaries (in Latin) on the New Testament, and on the
five Prophets, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonas.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Liber Psalmorum Davidis.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Dictionnaire des Mots François tournés en Latin.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Adagiorum chiliades quatuor, cum sesquicenturia Erasmi, cum H.
Stephani animadversionibus.” Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">This edition of the famous “<i>Adagia</i>” of Erasmus, first published in 1500,
contained the latest revisions of the author. After the death of Erasmus,
which had occurred in 1536, his works fell into the public domain and were
reprinted by any publishers who were interested in them. This edition of
Robert Estienne contained the first work as an editor and commentator of
his son Henry.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1559. This was the last year of Robert’s typographical labours.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The more important impressions were:</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Kimhi in Habacuc, recognitus a Vatablo.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“De Cœna Domini plana et perspicua tractatio in qua Joachimi Westphali

<li class="ifrst">“Calvini Institutio Christianæ Religionis, in libros quatuor nunc primum
digesta, certisque capitibus distincta.” Folio.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>Institutes</i> is the great work of Calvin, and is possibly
the most important intellectual production of the
Reformation. This edition of Robert Estienne’s contained
the final revision of the author, and was given by
the author to the public as the <i>édition définitive</i>. The
publication of this authoritative edition of a book which
belongs to the distinctive literature not only of the sixteenth
century but of the world’s history, was a fitting
undertaking with which to close the labours of the great
publisher.</p>

<p>Robert Estienne died in the latter part of this year
1559, having continued actively engaged in the work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
his printing-office until within a few weeks of his death.
In the same year occurred the death of Henry II., the
French King, which was occasioned by a wound received
in a tournament. By Robert’s will, the bulk of his property,
including the printing-office and publishing business
in Geneva, was left to his son Henry, who had for some
years been actively associated in its management, and
who had inherited a full measure of his father’s scholarly
interests and business capacity. The second son, Robert,
who had remained in Paris as a printer, was, according to
Maittaire, disinherited, possibly because he had thrown in
his lot with the extreme Catholics of the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>Thuanus ascribes to Robert Estienne the praise of
excelling in judgment and in technical skill and elegance
such masters of the typographical art as Aldus and
Froben. Without lessening the praise justly belonging
to Estienne, it must be remembered in any comparison
of his publications with those of Aldus, that the work of
the latter was carried on fifty years earlier, when it was
necessary to do much more creative work in organising
book-making appliances, and when the difficulties in the
way of distributing books were still greater than those
with which Estienne had to contend. Thuanus is on
firmer ground when he asserts that more real lustre and
glory were reflected upon the reign of Francis I. by the
genius and exertions of this single individual than by all
the achievements of that monarch, whether in peace or
in war. Scævola Sammasthanus speaks of Estienne as
<i>Typographus solertissimus et splendidissimus</i>, and Gesner, in
inscribing to him the fifth book of his <i>Pandects</i>, terms
him <i>entre les Imprimeurs et Libraires ce qu’est le soleil
entre les étoiles</i>.</p>

<p>The exceptional personal erudition of Robert Estienne,
the distinctive importance of his publishing undertakings,
the zeal evinced by him from the beginning of his career
for the advancement of learning and for critical scholarship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and the courageous fight made by him against the
assumption of the bigoted divines of the Sorbonne of the
right to exercise censorship over a literature of the very
language of which they were for the most part ignorant,
constitute the grounds for my selection of him as the
most worthy representative of the printer-publishers of
France of the sixteenth century, and for presenting with
some little detail the chief incidents of his career. While
the early memoirs give pretty full information concerning
the literary side of Estienne’s publishing undertakings
and present also the history of his long series of contests
in behalf of the freedom of the Press, the records of the
business details of his enterprises are scanty and inadequate.
We have no such information as has been preserved
in the account books of Aldus, Koberger, and
Plantin, showing the cost of the production of his books,
or the amounts paid to editors and authors. The extent
of the financial aid extended to Robert by the wise
liberality of King Francis is also not clearly specified,
although we can realise how important in many ways this
royal assistance must have been, and especially in connection
with the use of the great fonts of Greek type for the
making of which the King had paid. We know that he
was the only one of the pioneer printers who secured any
intelligent and effective co-operation from a royal treasury,
and we know also that important as this co-operation
was, it was in the end more than offset by the disastrous
antagonism of the ecclesiastics of the Sorbonne, whose
persistency finally triumphed over both king and printer.</p>

<p>Information is also wanting as to the channels which
were available for the distribution of the books when
made, and concerning the methods employed for their
sale. It is, in fact, very difficult to understand how, during
a period of frequent war, when communications were
irregular and travel was difficult not only between France
and the adjoining states, but throughout the kingdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
itself, it could have proved practicable to secure a remunerative
sale for costly works of such special character
as the majority of those issued by Estienne. The difficulty
must have been considerable even in making known
to scholars throughout Europe the fact of the publication
of the books, and after the orders were received, there
remained the task of making the deliveries and of collecting
the payments. It is further to be borne in mind that
the adverse influence of the divines of the Sorbonne must
have hampered materially the demand from university
and ecclesiastical centres for the editions of the Scriptures
and for all the works possessing any theological character,
while it was the case that of the Bibles at least, the sale
was absolutely blocked for several long periods. Notwithstanding
all the difficulties and obstacles, Estienne
must have succeeded in building up throughout Europe
a remunerative demand for his publications, for at the
time of his migration from France he was reputed to be
a man of means, and even after all the losses and expenses
attending the sudden closing of his concern in
Paris and its re-establishment in Geneva, he was able, a
few years later, to leave to his son a business on an assured
foundation, and resources for carrying it on. An
important part of these resources consisted in a great
collection of texts, both printed and in manuscript, and
in a comprehensive and valuable library. The career of
Robert Estienne was assuredly both distinctive and
honourable, and the services rendered by him to the
cause of scholarly literature fairly entitle him to the name
of the Aldus of France.</p>

<p>Some years after Robert’s death, the charge was made
by some of his old-time opponents that he had wrongfully
carried away to Geneva certain of the matrices of
the Greek type which belonged to the <i>Imprimerie Royale</i>
of Paris, and of which he had the use as Printer to the
King. According to Le Clerc, Robert took with him not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the matrices, but the punches (<i>les poinçons des matrices</i>) of
certain of the Greek fonts which had been made for the
<i>Imprimerie Royale</i>, but this theory does not accord with
the final history. It seems certainly to have been the
case that the type used by Robert’s son Henry for Greek
books issued by him in Geneva after the death of his
father, was identical with that of the royal Greek
characters which had been made for King Francis under
Robert’s supervision. Greswell is of opinion that the
charge was well founded, but he points out certain considerations
which probably influenced Robert’s action,
and which seemed to him (as they seemed to Maittaire) to
constitute, in some measure at least, a justification for
such action. Robert left Paris hurriedly, and it could in
any case have been no easy task to arrange for the transportation
of the material of his printing-office and publishing
concern without attracting the attention of his
enemies in the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>1. If information had been given to King Henry concerning
the preparations of the printer, the removal would
doubtless have been forbidden. If Robert had taken
pains to deposit the matrices in the chamber of accounts
(where the punches of the three fonts were preserved in
boxes lined with velvet),<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> he would at once have betrayed
his plans for removal.</p>

<p>2. The removal of this set of matrices does not appear
to have excited any sensation whatsoever, either at the
time of Robert’s departure or at any later period; nor do
we hear of any impediment being caused through the
want of them to the business of the future <i>Impressores
Regii</i>.</p>

<p>3. At the time of Robert’s departure, the royal treasury
was greatly in arrears to Robert, not merely for the
King’s promised remuneration of his losses, which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>malevolence of the divines had intercepted, but also for
the stipend due to him as <i>regius typographus</i>. He may,
therefore, have believed himself to be warranted in
retaining the set of matrices either as an offset or as a
pledge.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>4. Chevillier, and others of the authorities of the time,
writing from the Catholic point of view, while very indignant
with Robert for having induced two monarchs to
give to him, “an outrageous Calvinist heretic,” the post
of royal printer, make no mention of this accusation,
while they would certainly have been very ready, if they
had before them any evidence of such a theft, to include
it among the sins of the heretical printer.</p>

<p>M. de Guignes finds evidence that under the reign of
Louis XIII. certain of the divines of the Sorbonne, who
had in preparation a new edition of the Greek Fathers,
presented a petition to that prince requesting that the
Greek matrices might be repurchased from Geneva, and
that, in consequence of this petition, the King, in May,
1619, directed the sum of three thousand livres to be paid
for them to Paul Estienne, the grandson of Robert, and
that the matrices were brought back to the royal printing-house.</p>

<p>In the same essay, M. de Guignes mentions that in the
year 1700, the University of Cambridge requested the
Government (that of Louis XIV.) to favour it with a cast
or font of the Greek characters of Francis I., then known
by the name of “the King’s Greek.” The matter was
referred to the French Academy, which expressed its
willingness to send the font, under the condition that in
all works in which the characters were used, there should
be placed at the bottom of the title-page, after the usual
subscription <i>Typis Academicis</i>, the words <i>Characteribus
Græcis e Typographeo regio Parisiensi</i>. To this stipulation,
however, the curators of the Cambridge University</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>
<p>Press were not willing to consent, and the negotiation
therefore fell through. The incident indicates that after
the lapse of a century and a half, the Greek type planned
by Estienne was still considered to excel fonts of later
workmanship.</p>

<p class="dropcap noin">IT is not necessary for the purpose of this study to give
the record in detail of the careers and publishing
undertakings of all the printers of the great family
of the Estiennes. I have been interested in presenting
with some fulness the account of the life and work of
Robert, because he stands out as the most distinctive and
forcible member of a famous literary family, and because
his experience illustrates very fairly the characteristic
features and the chief difficulties of the business of publishing
books in France in the first half of the sixteenth
century. The business careers of the brothers and of the
descendants of Robert should be mentioned, however, if
only to indicate the exceptional position occupied by
this noteworthy family in the history of printing and
publishing, and the extent of the influence exercised by
it through successive generations upon the production of
scholarly literature.</p>

<p>Robert’s elder brother, Francis, was a <i>libraire juré</i> of
the University of Paris. His publications were comprised
within the ten years from 1537 to 1547. He used
as a mark a tripos which stands upon a closed book and
from which issues a vine shoot. The motto is <i>Plus olei
quam vini</i>. This is sometimes followed by the adage,
which seems rather a truism than a truth, πάντων<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
δυσχερέστατον τὸ πᾶσιν ἀρέσκειν, “Of all things, the
most difficult is to please everybody.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> With the exception
of one <i>Psalterium</i> and a <i>Horæ Virginis</i> in Greek, his
few impressions were all in Latin, and were chiefly issues
of the classics. He appears never to have come into
conflict with the divines whose censorship gave so much
trouble to his brother Robert.</p>

<p>Charles Estienne, who was the youngest of the three
brothers, was known as a printer and publisher in Paris
between the years 1550 and 1560. He had originally
adopted the profession of medicine and attained high
reputation as a physician and naturalist, and as a classical
and antiquarian scholar. While travelling in Italy, he
became intimate with Paul Manutius, the son of Aldus.
He was a voluminous author, and the first productions
of his Press were the work of his own pen, and comprised
a treatise on Dissection, a series of volumes on
Horticulture, issued under the title of <i>Prædium Rusticum</i>,
a work on Birds, and one on Fishes. He also wrote a
history of the Dukes of Milan, a description of the Rivers
of France, and a number of narratives of travel. Finally,
he produced a number of critical works, such as a <i>Dictionarium
Latino-Gallicum</i>.</p>

<p>This was published in 1552, and again in 1561, and
remained for many years a scholarly authority on its subject,
and was honoured by being largely “appropriated.”
Cooper’s <i>Thesaurus Linguæ Romanæ</i>, published in London
in 1565, was said by Dr. White Kennett to be a <i>verbatim</i>
transcript of Stephen’s Dictionary.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It seems
evident from the above brief summary that Charles
Estienne secured an honourable position as a scholar and
as an author.</p>

<p>In order to indicate the direction of his publishing
interests, I select a few of the more important of the titles
from his catalogue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>
<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1554. “Compendium Michlol, authore Rodolpho Bayno Cantabrigiense,
et sanctæ linguæ professore Regio Lutetiæ Parisior.” 4to. The author
was an Englishman from York, who had accepted a professorship at Paris.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Institutiones Linguæ Syriacæ, Assyriacæ atque Thalmudicæ una cum
Æthiopicæ atque Arabicæ collatione, Angelo Caninio Anglarensi, authore.”
4to.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1555. “Ciceronis Opera omnia.” 4 vols. Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1558. “Petri Bunelli familiares aliquot epistolæ in adolescentulorum,
Ciceronis studiosorum gratiam.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">Petrus Bunellus was a native of Toulouse, who had studied in Italy,
where he had for four years lived with Paul Manutius. He had evidently
shared the interest of his friend and host in the writings of Cicero.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1559. “Plutarque de la honte vicieuse, par Fr. le Grand.” 8vo.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Histoire du siège de Metz en 1552, par Barthélemy de Salignac.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Traicté de la guerre de Malte, par de Villegagnon.” 4to.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Missives de B. de Salignac, contenant le voyage du Roy Henry II.
aux Pays-Bas.” 4to.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“De Latinis et Græcis nominibus arborum fruticum, herbarum, piscium
et avium liber; ex Aristotele, Theophrasto, Galeno,” etc. This is described
as an original and learned work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The famous scholar Scaliger charges Charles Estienne
with vanity and irritability of temper, but a publisher may
be angry occasionally without any permanent imputation
upon his morals or character. Scaliger had, by a breach
of promise and by ill usage, given to Estienne just cause
of offence. He had promised to place with Estienne the
publication for France of all his works, while he afterwards
committed to Vascosan and others such of them
as seemed most likely to prove profitable undertakings.
To Charles Estienne he offered those which on account
of their special character promised neither popularity nor
advantage. Under these circumstances, Estienne returned
Scaliger’s manuscripts with an expression of indignation.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Robert Estienne the second was the eldest son of
Robert Estienne the first, and had been brought up in the
business of his more famous father. He did not accompany
the latter on his removal to Geneva, having refused
to abandon the Catholic faith. His remaining in Paris
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>brought to him certain business advantages, as he was put
in charge of the royal printing-office. As a further mark
of confidence, and possibly as special consideration for his
fidelity to the Catholic faith after the rest of his family
had gone over to the heretics, Charles IX. further honoured
him with a royal commission to travel in Italy in
search of manuscripts and rare books for use in the publishing
undertakings of the Royal Press, and appointed a
provision for his family during his absence. In 1563,
Robert received the formal appointment as <i>Typographus
Regius</i>, and by that date he appears to have fully reconstituted
his father’s establishment in Paris. He numbered
among his friends and clients some of the principal
scholars of the age, including Joseph Scaliger, George
Buchanan, Sir Thomas Smith, and others, and appears to
have fully maintained the family reputation for scholarly
attainments and for devotion to higher literature.</p>

<p>Among his more important publications may be cited:</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1565. “Josephi Scaligeri conjectanea in Varronem de Lingua Latina.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1566. “Georgii Buchanani Scoti Psalmorum Davidis Paraphrasis
poetica.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Psalmi Aliquot a Theodoro Beza versi.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1568. “De recta et emendata linguæ Græcæ pronounciatione Thomæ
Smith. Angli, tunc in Acad. Cantabr. publici prælectoris, ad Vintoniensem
episcopum Epistola.” 4to.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“De recta et emendata linguæ Anglicæ scriptione Dialogus, Thoma
Smitho equestris ordinis Anglo authore.” 4to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scaliger, while an Italian by race and a Frenchman
by birth, is more usually associated with Holland, where
he passed the greater part of his working years. As
professor of belles-lettres in Leyden, he had among his
pupils the celebrated Grotius. He was himself possibly
the most noted of the group of Protestant scholars whose
learning and attainments secured for the Reformers of the
time an intellectual superiority over their Catholic opponents,
a superiority which had as one result a decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
revival of letters within the Church of Rome. The
original editions of his books were issued in Leyden,
but he was able, as noted above, to arrange for the publication
in Paris of authorised editions from which he
derived a profit, and of certain of these works editions
appeared also in Basel.</p>

<p>George Buchanan, poet and historian, is best known in
connection with his service as tutor for Mary Queen of
Scots, and later, as preceptor for her son James. The
latter was possibly largely indebted to Buchanan for his
interest and proficiency in classical studies. Sir Thomas
Smith was the English Ambassador at Paris. The interest
of scholarly foreigners such as those named, in securing
for their books the imprint of Estienne, indicates that the
repute of the firm had already extended beyond the limits
of France.</p>

<p>Henry Estienne the second, second son of Robert, carried
on in Geneva, after the death of his father, what may
be called the Protestant branch of the publishing concern,
for a few years, when he returned to Paris and established
there a second Estienne Press. He was apparently
the most finished scholar of his scholarly family, and
from an early age, before he had entered upon business
responsibilities, we find him engaged in work as editor
and translator. His father had taken special pains with
his education, and as a part of his general training had
caused him to travel as a young man in Italy, England,
and the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Henry had secured a familiarity with Latin in his home
circle, where, as before stated, Latin was practically the
language of the household. He took his first instruction
in Greek from Petrus Danesius, one of the Greek scholars
who had been brought to the royal college of Francis I.
He spent nearly four years in travel and in sojourn in
Italy, busying himself while there in collecting and collating
manuscripts for his father’s Press. Maittaire states<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
that he collated for this purpose no fewer than fifteen manuscripts
of Æschylus. Certain annotations made by him
in his transcript of <i>Athenæus</i> were subsequently utilised
by his son-in-law, the famous scholar Casaubon, in the
edition printed forty years later.</p>

<p>In Venice he became acquainted with the Greek scholar
Muretus, who, in addition to his work in the University of
Padua, had for a number of years given editorial assistance
in the Greek division of the Aldine Press. In Henry’s diary
of his journey, he speaks of being present at a gathering in
Rome of <i>literati</i> and poets, who ignorantly condemned
Hebrew <i>ut linguam asperam et horridam</i>. The young publisher
who was well versed in Hebrew, successfully defended
the sacred language and resolutely vindicated the cause
both of David and his interpreters.</p>

<p>A little later, he met, in Florence, Petrus Victorius, one
of the most profound Greek scholars at that time in Italy.
Henry was able to present to his host a valuable <i>Codex</i> of
Anacreon which the Greek professor had not before been
acquainted with. In 1550, Henry’s travels extended to
England, where he was introduced, as a scholar of note, to
King Edward VI. From England, he went to Flanders
and became intimate with some of the scholars of Louvain.
While in Flanders, he devoted himself to mastering the
Spanish language, and he brought back with him from Antwerp
to Paris the texts of certain Spanish classics of which
he printed French versions. In the twenty-sixth year of
his age, he returned to Paris to begin his active business
career, for which he had certainly taken pains thoroughly
to equip himself.</p>

<p>He began his publishing undertakings in 1554, with an
edition of <i>Anacreon</i>, beautifully printed in quarto. The
volume contains, in addition to the Greek text, Latin versions
of the <i>Odes</i> prepared by the publisher who himself
acted as editor. During 1555, he was again in Italy collecting
and collating manuscripts. In 1556, he issued an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
edition of the <i>Psalms</i> presented in a Latin version which
was the combined work of George Buchanan a Scotchman,
M. A. Flaminius an Italian, Solomon Macrinus a Frenchman,
and Helius Eobanus a German. He was this year
busily engaged, in company with other scholars, in
editorial work on the <i>Thesaurus Græcus</i>.</p>

<p>In 1557, he produced editions of <i>Æschylus</i>, <i>Aristotle</i>,
<i>Theophrastus</i>, and <i>Athenagoras</i>. The notes to <i>Æschylus</i>
were the work of the scholar Petrus Victorius, with whom
Henry had a long-time friendship. In this year was also
issued the <i>Lexicon Ciceronianum Græco-Latinum</i>, which
had been compiled by himself and in which he had brought
together whatever passages or material Cicero had utilised
from philosophers, historians, poets, or essayists. This
work secured for its compiler and publisher high repute
as a scholar of wide attainments.</p>

<p>In 1558, Henry assumed the appellation of a <i>Typographus
illustris viri Huldrici Fuggeri, Domini in Kirchberg
et Weyssenhorn</i>.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Huldric Fugger was a native of
Augsburg, born in 1526, and belonging to a family conspicuous
for its antiquity, its mercantile ability, and its wealth.
Huldric was himself a scholar, and became an eminent
patron of literary men. He expended very great sums in
the purchase of trustworthy manuscripts of ancient authors,
and in having produced from these satisfactory printed
editions. Henry Scrimger, a Scotch professor of considerable
erudition, was engaged by him, on terms described
as magnificent, to carry into effect those literary
undertakings. Scrimger was an old friend of Henry Estienne,
and it was undoubtedly at his instance that the
baron conceived the plan of appointing Henry as his typographus.
The printer received from Fugger for some
years a pension of fifty gold crowns, but I have been
unable to find any specification of the precise nature of the
services which were given in consideration of this payment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>
<p>Expenditure for the promotion of literature was still very
exceptional, and it is perhaps not surprising that the
family of Huldric considered his patronage of letters as
evidence of a deranged mind. They instituted a legal
process, and succeeded in inducing the court to take their
view of Huldric’s actions. They secured a decree which
caused him to be declared incapable of the administration
of his own property, and he was for a time placed under
guardians. Eventually, however, he recovered possession
of his property, and in fact succeeded also to the estate of
his brother. With increased resources, he resumed his
interest in collecting books, and at his death, in Heidelberg,
in 1584, he bequeathed to the Palatinate a very fine
library. It is probable, however, that his confinement had
tended to mitigate his ardour for expending money in
printing books, and his relations with Estienne were not
resumed. The several experiences endured by this would-be
German Mæcenas may have helped to discourage future
similar attempts to further the production of good literature.
If the expenditure of money in the production of
books and the collection of libraries were to be accepted
as evidences of mental derangement, it is not surprising
that the printers and publishers of Germany secured
during the sixteenth century very little patronage or
compensation from the nobility of the land.</p>

<p>Huldric Fugger was, however, not the only one of his
family who interested himself in literature. His elder
brother, Joannes Jacobus, had a fine collection of books
both printed and in manuscript, and was proficient in
Greek. Other members of the family were in relations
with Paul Manutius in Italy, with Koberger of Nuremberg,
and with Froben of Basel.</p>

<p>The first book printed by Henry Estienne under his
new designation of <i>Huldrici Fuggeri Typographus</i>, was an
edition of the <i>Edicts</i> of Justinian, printed in Greek and
Latin, which bears date 1558. In 1559, he issued the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
<i>Bibliotheca</i> of Diodorus, with annotations of his own, and
in 1561, a very elaborate edition of the complete writings
of <i>Xenophon</i>.</p>

<p>After the death, in 1559, of Henry II. and in 1560, of the
young King Francis II., there was for a number of years,
during the minority of Charles IX., a time of trouble and
disturbance for France, during which literary undertakings
and business enterprises were of necessity seriously interfered
with. The Calvinists, who had been rapidly increasing
in numbers throughout the kingdom, were making an
earnest fight for consistent toleration, and, later, for official
recognition and for equality with the Catholics before the
law, a contention which was actively opposed by the
Guises, and (with occasional pretensions of concession) by
the Queen-Mother, Catharine of Medici. The result was
a series of civil wars, with only occasional brief interludes
of truce and quiet.</p>

<p>In 1562, Estienne completed the publication of certain
theological works which had been left unfinished in Geneva
at the time of his father’s death,—an Exposition of
the New Testament and an Exposition of the Psalms.</p>

<p>The editor, a certain Marloratus, a Huguenot minister at
Rouen, was unfortunately, before the printing was completed,
hanged as a heretic, under the direction of the Duke
of Guise, but the books themselves were not suppressed
nor was the publisher interfered with. In fact, the Faculty
of the Sorbonne appears for the time to have suspended
its censorious watchfulness over heretical publications,
perhaps because it found its hands sufficiently
full with the active work of suppressing by fire, gibbet, and
sword the heretics themselves.</p>

<p>Henry Estienne had, as stated, established his printing-office
in Paris, where his business may be considered as in
a measure a continuation of the concern of his father Robert,
although the post of printer to the King had, as we
have noted, been given to his uncle. Henry continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
however, to print a certain portion of his books in Geneva,
although it is not clear whether or not he retained the
control of, or even an ownership in, the Press which had
been established there by his father.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He appears at this
time to have divided his publishing undertakings, executing
at Paris reprints of the classics and of works in general
literature, and reserving for the Geneva Press theological
works which were likely to give offence in a period of
“religious irritation.” This term is, I may mention, Maittaire’s,
and it is perhaps not too strong a description of a
period in which a divine who had taken no part in politics
could be hanged simply for editing a Protestant commentary.</p>

<p>I add some further selections of certain of the more
important of the titles from Henry’s Catalogue.</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1563. “Rudimenta Fidei Christianæ; addita est ecclesiasticarum precum
formula; Græc. Lat.” 12mo.</li>

<li class="ifrst">This is Calvin’s Catechism, translated into Greek by Henry himself.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“De abusu linguæ Græcæ in quibusdem vocibus, quas Latina usurpat
admonitio.” 8vo. Of this treatise Henry was author as well as publisher.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1564. “Fragmenta Pœtarum Veterum Latinorum, quorum opera non
extant, Ennii, Accii, Lucilii” etc. This work was undertaken out of regard
for the memory of his father, by whom the fragments had been collected,
but who had not been able to complete the preparation of them for the
press.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1566. “La confirmation de la discipline ecclésiastique observée dans les
églises réformées du royaume de France; avec la résponse aux objections
proposées à l’encontre.” This was printed in Geneva.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the same year, was issued a Greek <i>Anthology</i> to
which the publisher added certain annotations of his own.
By way of exciting the emulation of young poets, Henry
promised an addition of such Greek epigrams as had been
turned into Latin metre by himself and others, and as a
proof of his own facility, he introduced into his annotations
to the <i>Anthology</i> above mentioned more than fifty
translations of a single distich.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>
<p>The publisher, in thus assuming responsibilities as an
author, could, of course, not escape the criticism of other
authors claiming authority in the same studies. Vavasseur,
for instance, says of Henry’s literary productions:
“His verse is more faulty than his prose, his numbers are
harsh and unpolished, his muse is often triflingly diffuse.
He is fluent in writing, but frequently not correct. He
is both fastidious and dictatorial, talking freely of others
and much of himself, and forgetting the modesty which
becomes the author.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is fair to remember that Father
Vavasseur was a Jesuit and was possibly, therefore, no
dispassionate judge of the defects of the scholarly but
heretical publisher.</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1566. “Herodoti Historiæ Libri IX. et de vita Homeri Libellus,
Latine. Folio.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This edition comprises also the <i>Opuscula</i> of Herodotus, Plutarch, and
Porphyrius, relating to Homer’s life and poesy.</li>
</ul>

<p>M. de Sallengre relates that Henry Estienne, having
printed at a great expense the histories of Herodotus,
his enemies and above all the monks, who sought every
occasion to bring trouble upon him, decried his history as
filled with fables <i>et de contes à dormir debout</i>, and that
Henry, to repel the effect of this accusation, undertook
to justify himself by the composition of the following
treatise, <i>Apologia pro Herodoto, sive Herodoti Historia
fabulositatis accusata</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>Apologia</i> is described by Greswell as a serious performance,
containing nothing that should be particularly
offensive to the monks or to the Roman clergy, unless it
be an incidental mention of <i>La papesse Jeanne</i> and a
description of certain superstitions that Estienne had
observed in his visit to the Church of our Lady of
Loretto.</p>

<p>The <i>Apologia</i> was, later, prefixed to another issue of a
Latin version of <i>Herodotus</i> and was subsequently printed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>in French in a separate volume under the title <i>L’apologie
pour Hérodote</i>.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Apologia</i> appears to have been amplified and extended
and to have been made the vehicle of a severe
attack upon the Roman Hierarchy and a means of exposing
the ignorance and vices of its ecclesiastics, the
fooleries of their pulpit elocution, the astonishing credulity
of the laity instructed by them, and the laxity of discipline
and deterioration of manners which seemed to be the inevitable
result of a corrupt faith. Greswell is of opinion
that the motives which led to this attack are not to be
sought for in any imaginary affront which Henry had experienced
through the monkish accusations against his
<i>Herodotus</i>, but that they were rather to be found in the
irritation occasioned by the persecutions from which his
family had suffered and in his rooted antipathy to the
principles of the Church of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Maittaire’s description of Henry’s criticism of the manners
and works of the monks recalls certain portions of
the <i>Encomium Moriæ</i> of Erasmus. The author’s general
line of argument is as follows: The circumstances related
by Herodotus in his History ought not to be pronounced
fables on account of their seeming want of verisimilitude,
as in recent times many things have happened which,
though in themselves apparently far less probable than
much that Herodotus has recorded, cannot be called in
question. It is contended further that it is impossible for
men ever to have been so stupid and so gross as Herodotus
describes them; but Henry shows by undeniable examples
how excessive in all respects was the grossness of many of
those who lived in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries,
persons who were probably no less degraded than were
the classes whose lives are recorded by Herodotus. In
the account of the wrong-doings and degradation of later
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>generations, Henry does not spare the monks, who are
attacked without mercy, and he speaks with hardly more
reserve of the popes themselves. It is difficult to understand
why divines of the Sorbonne, whose theological ire
had been so bitter against Robert Estienne on account of
Greek annotations to the Testament, should have allowed
to pass, apparently without a protest, so sweeping a denunciation
of the character of the ecclesiastics.</p>

<p>According to De Sallengre, the <i>Apologia</i> was a book
which everyone wished to possess. It was read with
avidity, and editions of it were multiplied. The first
three, all printed in Geneva, were issued before the close
of the year 1566. The fourth, fifth, and sixth were
printed at Antwerp in 1567, 1568, and 1569. The seventh,
eighth, ninth, and tenth were printed at Rochelle (the
centre of French Protestantism) between 1572 and 1582,
and the eleventh and twelfth at Lyons in 1592 and 1607.
These editions were all superseded by that printed at The
Hague in 1735, with notes by M. le Duchat.</p>

<p>An anonymous translation appeared in London in 1607,
under the title of <i>A World of Wonders, or an Introduction
to a treatise touching the conformitie of ancient and
modern wonders; or a Preparative Treatise to the Apologie
for Herodotus, the argument of which is taken from the
Apologie for Herodotus written by Henry Stephen, etc</i>.
I have thought it worth while to present the specification
of the editions of a book which achieved, if not fame, at
least popularity, as an indication of the activity of the
printing-presses even during a period of political strife
and of widely extended wars.</p>

<p>The book appears never to have been put into print in
Paris, as it was doubtless not considered wise to test too
severely the censorship of the University. According to
De Sallengre, copies were, however, in very general circulation
in Paris society, which was always ready to be
amused with the recital of clerical enormities and with
pictures of the scandals of private life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>The years 1562 and 1563 were signalised by active
operations in the continued strife between the Protestants
and the Catholics, and while, after 1563, there was a brief
cessation of hostilities, the civil war broke out again in
1567 and continued with brief intervals until the Massacre
of S. Bartholomew in 1572. In each one of these years
of disturbance, however, we find Henry Estienne’s imprint
associated with important publications, principally
reissues of the classics, although it is not easy to understand
how it could have proved practicable to secure any
continued sale at this time in France for costly editions,
or how there was in fact any opportunity of interesting
the public or of bringing adequately to the attention of
the public, books of any class. The frequent interference
with the communications between Paris and the cities
east of the Rhine must also have rendered it very difficult
to arrange for the distribution of French editions in
Germany, or in the Low Countries, while the latter were
themselves in the throes of the great rebellion against the
dominion of Spain.</p>

<p>In 1568, Henry printed <i>Henrici Stephani annotationes
in Sophoclem et Euripidem</i>, etc., which is evidence that
such little matters as the battles of St. Denis and Jarnac
were not permitted to interfere with his classical studies
any more than with the work of his printing-office. In
the next year, he issued another work from his own pen:
<i>Comicorum Græcorum sententiæ, id est Gnomæ, Græce
Latinis versibus ab H. Stephano redditæ, et annotationibus
illustratæ</i>. He also completed the publication of a
collection of Latin historians. The list of the year includes
a number of other titles of which the most
important (with reference at least to the personality of
Henry) were the two following:</p>

<ul><li class="ifrst"><i>Artis Typographicæ querimonia et Epitaphia typographorum
quorundam, per H. Stephanum</i>. 4to; and</li>

<li class="ifrst"><i>Henrici Stephani epistola de suæ typographiæ statu;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Index librorum qui ex ejusdem officina hætenus prodierunt.</i>
8vo.</li></ul>

<p>The former is a lament concerning the degradation of
the noble art of typography. An art which had, as he
complains, fallen into the hands of the most illiterate of
persons, <i>quibus nihil cum musis commune est</i>. “What,”
he exclaims, “would Aldus Manutius say if, returning to
life, he could behold the present miserable condition of
the art to which his life was devoted!” He then proceeds
to adduce various instances of the gross ignorance and
corresponding obstinacy of some of the printers and
editors of his time, exemplified by their adulteration of
particular passages of classic authors. These quotations
are followed by a number of <i>Latin Elegiacs</i> and certain
<i>Epitaphia</i>, partly in Greek and partly in Latin, which
appear to have been included in the volume as evidence
that one printer at least, was both a classical scholar and a
man of literary capacity. It is doubtful whether the
condition of printing throughout Europe at this time
afforded any substantial justification for this sweeping
complaint of Henry’s. The presses of Plantin were,
during these very years, active in Antwerp, although
Plantin, like Estienne himself, was contending against
manifold difficulties in the task of carrying on an
international publishing business in the midst of civil war
and political disintegration; and the books produced by
Plantin will, not only for the beauty of their typography,
but especially for the perfection of the magnificent
copper-plate illustrations utilised for many of them,
stand favourable comparison with the productions of
earlier or later generations. The books issued in Nuremberg
during the same decade, by the second of the
Kobergers, who had built up the greatest publishing concern
that Germany had ever known, can also be specified
as excellent examples as well of scholarly editing as of
tasteful and accurate typography. It was doubtless the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
case that in Paris as elsewhere, there were, during the last
half of the sixteenth century, examples of scholarly and
ignorant editing and of careless and inaccurate typography,
but the same may be said of every century since
the time of Gutenberg. Henry Estienne’s essay may, I
think, be considered partly as an affectation and partly as
a piece of self-conceit.</p>

<p>The second of these monographs presents a description
of the status of his Press, together with an <i>Index librorum</i>
or classified catalogue of his publications. It forms in
fact the chief authority for the history of his business.
A considerable portion of the <i>Epistola</i> is devoted to a
description of the purpose and character of the great
<i>Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</i>, then in course of production.
Henry takes pains to explain that the plan and inception
of the <i>Thesaurus</i> were due to his father Robert, who had
in fact, before his death, collected a large amount of
material for the great etymological and lexicographical
undertaking, which may be considered, therefore, as the
work of two generations of scholarly publishers. Greswell
is in accord with Maittaire in describing the work as
an “admirable and unrivalled monument of ardent zeal
for the advancement of learning, and as an example of
unwearied diligence and of colossal erudition.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The remainder of the <i>Epistola</i> is devoted to a recital
of the injuries done to the authors of classical antiquity
by ignorant and careless editors and by credulous printers,
ready to accept on the authority of such editors new
readings and unfounded “emendations” in the text.
Henry announces that he has in preparation a treatise to
be entitled <i>De Origine Mendorum in authoribus Graecis et
Latinis</i>, but Greswell can find no evidence that this was
ever published.</p>

<p>The <i>Epistola</i> closes with a humorous complaint of the
trivial and harassing interruptions to which a scholarly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>publisher is exposed at the Frankfort Fair and elsewhere,
on the part of applicants for information concerning his
publishing undertakings and plans. The complaint is
printed in Latin iambics. I quote some of the lines as
Englished by Greswell. It will be noted that the <i>Index
librorum</i> or catalogue of Estienne had been printed for the
purpose of answering such inquiries in print. Aldus had,
it may be remembered, been driven to a similar course
in 1498, but catalogues were still the exception rather
than the rule.</p>

<p>Henry’s complaints concerning futile and troublesome
correspondence might, of course, be repeated in many a
publishing office to-day, but the modern publisher is
helped out of the difficulty to some extent by his stenographers
and typewriters. It remains a marvel how it
was possible, without any time-saving appliances, for the
publishers of the fifteenth century to conduct a complicated
business, to give personal labour to preparing for
the press works calling for original scholarship and detailed
labour, and to carry on, in autographic letters, literary
and theological correspondence.</p>

<p>The <i>Epistola</i> gives the titles or descriptions of a number
of important works which the ambitious publisher
had in plan, a list, in fact, too long to be completed within
the lifetime or to be feasible for the resources of any one
publisher, and only a portion of which were ever brought
to completion. In 1571, Henry issued, among other
works, an edition of the works of Plutarch, which gives
both the Greek and the Latin text, in thirteen volumes
octavo. In 1572, he completed the great <i>Thesaurus</i>, the
most important production of his busy life. The full title
is as follows:</p>

<p><i>Thesaurus Græcæ Linguæ, ab Henrico Stephano constructus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
in quo præter alia plurima quæ primus præstitit
(paternæ diligentiæ æmulus) vocabula in certas classes
distribuit, multiplici derivatorum serie ad primigenia,
tanquam ad radices unde pullulant, revocata. Thesaurus
Lectori.</i></p>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Nunc alii intrepide vestigia nostra sequantur;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Me duce, plana via est quæ salebrosa fuit.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin"><i>Anno MDLXXII. excudebat Henr. Stephanus, cum privilegio
Caes. Majestatis et Christianiss. Galliarum Regis.</i>
4 vols. Folio, with two supplementary volumes containing
an appendix and an index.</p>

<p>A seventh volume, issued a year later, adds two glossaries,
and a treatise on the dialects of Attica. This <i>Thesaurus
Græcus</i> was completed by Henry at about the
same age as that at which his father, Robert, had published
his Latin <i>Thesaurus</i>. The two works would have
been for any generation of publishers creditable examples
of scholarly and public-spirited enterprise, but when we
remember that the publishers were the compilers, and
were also the authors of the notes, commentaries, and
separate treatises which make up a large portion of the
bulk of the volumes, and that their work as editors
and authors was done amidst the engrossing cares of the
management in stormy times of a complex and absorbing
business, the <i>Thesauri</i> remain magnificent monuments to
the scholarship, the capacity, and the persistent energy of
the two Estiennes.</p>

<p>The <i>Thesaurus Græcus</i> was inscribed by Henry to the
Emperor Maximilian, Charles IX. of France, Elizabeth of
England, and John George, Marquis of Brandenburg.
He secured for it, in addition to the privilege of the
French King, which bears date 1561, that of the Emperor,
issued in 1570. In one of the several prefatory words
Henry tells his readers that the only way in which he had
found it practicable to complete his task, was to bind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
himself to produce each twenty-four hours, in readiness
for the compositors who had been detailed for the work,
a stated quantity of written matter. The interruptions
were often, he says, so frequent that he was obliged to
lay aside the pen ten times in an hour; but there were
few days on which the “copy” that he had pledged himself
to complete was not in readiness at the hour fixed.</p>

<p>Henry makes a special appeal to scholars and to the
public generally to protect his great work against any
piratical appropriations, or any attempts on the part of
epitomisers or abridgers. The appeal proved, however,
ineffective, and the <i>Thesaurus Græcus</i> was utilised as
a convenient quarry by a number of later lexicographers.
Greswell makes special mention of Joannes Scapula as
the first of the plagiarists who took advantage of the
labours of Henry. He states that Scapula had been employed
as one of Henry’s correctors, a position which
gave him convenient facilities for an early appropriation
of the sheets of Henry’s lexicon. The <i>Lexicon Græco-Latinum</i>,
which bears the name of Scapula, was printed in Basel
in 1579. In his introduction, he speaks of having had the
plan of the undertaking long in mind, and of having, in
fact, made considerable progress in his work before
Henry’s volumes were printed. He does not admit the
appropriation, or even the use of any of Henry’s material,
although, as Maittaire points out, whole pages of the
Basel lexicon are substantially identical with those of the
Paris work.</p>

<p>The lexicon of Scapula being in smaller and less costly
form, was found of convenience to students generally, but
the scholars of Henry’s generation did not hesitate to
censure severely the conduct of Scapula and to make
strong condemnations of his literary dishonesty. Maittaire
quotes Malinkrot to this effect, and records also that
the celebrated Dr. Busby, of Westminster School, actually
forbade his pupils, on the ground of indignation at literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
larceny, to use what he called “the surreptitious
lexicon” of Scapula. The instance is worth commemorating,
because it marks a distinct advance in the development
of popular, or at least of scholarly, opinion in
regard to the rights of literary producers. There had
been not a few examples in previous generations of indignation
on the part of authors or editors concerning the
appropriation of their own works, indignation which was,
to be sure, chiefly concerned not with the diminution of
the author’s proceeds, but with the risk or certainty that
the surreptitious editions would be garbled and inaccurate,
and would thus cause injustice to the reputation of
the author. I do not, however, find previous record of
instances in which scholars or readers not personally associated
with the author, had taken pains, simply on the
ground of literary ethics, to discountenance or discourage
surreptitious or piratical editions.</p>

<p>It remains to add concerning the <i>Thesaurus</i>, that, in
common with not a few other public-spirited publishing
undertakings, it brought to its author-publisher loss
instead of profits. Henry complains that the publication
involved him in serious pecuniary difficulties. La Caille
is authority for the statement that these difficulties and the
honour brought upon France by Henry’s publications were
made the ground of a donation, in 1578, by King Henry
III. of three thousand livres. Maittaire is, however, clear
in his mind that while the King had talked about such a
compensation, and may even have promised it, the money
was never paid. The instance appears in several respects
to be parallel with that of the big Bible of Plantin, in
connection with the publication of which Plantin received
from Philip II. promises many, but no cash. A second
edition was printed in 1572, the sale of which may have
helped to lessen the publisher’s loss. This was, however,
the year of the massacre of S. Bartholomew and of the battles
of Brissac and Moncontour, and it is probable that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the business of selling books could hardly have been in a
satisfactory condition.</p>

<p>In 1574, Estienne printed an edition of <i>Apollonius
Rhodius</i>, and, in 1575, a work of his own composition
entitled <i>Pseudo-Cicero Dialogus H. Stephani</i>, and, in the
year following, a curious treatise compiled by himself, entitled
<i>H. Stephani Schediasmatum Variorum</i>. This year
also witnessed the completion of a magnificent impression
of the works of <i>Plato</i>, the editorial work on which was
done largely by himself. According to Maittaire and
Fischer, hardly a single typographical error is to be found
in the three volumes. The first volume is dedicated to
Elizabeth, Queen of England, the second to James VI. of
Scotland, and the third to the Republic of Berne.</p>

<p>King Henry III. showed an intelligent interest in the
work of the Estienne Press, and appears to have extended
to the printer not a few marks of royal favour, although,
as Maittaire points out, it was the case in many instances
that the gifts of money proffered by the King did not get
beyond the stage of promises. In 1578, the King sent
Henry into Switzerland in search of manuscripts and rare
books, and in 1579, he conferred on him a general privilege,
“<i>Tant pour tous les Historiens Grecs et Latins que pour la
Dictionnaire et Cours Civile.</i>”</p>

<p>It is evident, from the various headings of the printer’s
letters, that he was continually shifting his residence.
He writes most frequently, to be sure, from Paris, but
very often from Geneva, and again from Berne, Orleans,
Lyons, and Frankfort. He appears to have given his
personal attention, during many years, to the business of
his House at the Frankfort Fair. It is sufficiently surprising
that, with this migratory life, he was able to bring
to a successful conclusion so many important editorial and
publishing undertakings, especially as the work of the
printing-office was so often interrupted by war or rumours
of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span></p>

<p>The years 1578-1583 chronicled the production of a
number of important books, chiefly editions of the classics.
An edition of <i>Herodotus</i>, issued in 1581, the publisher
dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney, with a prefatory address
in which he reminds Sidney of their former literary intercourse,
first in Germany and later in Austria. During
1584, Henry’s Press appears to have been idle, but the
five following years show a renewed activity. The assassination
of his royal patron, Henry III., in 1588, did not
fail to call forth the lamentations of Estienne’s muse, but
his <i>Epitaphia</i> on the monarch are said to evince more
loyalty than poetic excellence.</p>

<p>The last work bearing Henry’s imprint was an edition
of the <i>Poemata Varia</i> of Beza, which bears the date of
1579. Henry’s death came in 1598, in a hospital at
Lyons. The seventy years of his active and eventful life
had brought, as an offset to the well merited prestige and
honours that had been accorded to him for his distinctive
services, a full measure of vicissitudes and reverses. His
life was full of sharp contrasts. He had intimate relations
with many of the rich and great, and he found himself
associated not infrequently with the splendours of
courts and enjoyed the favour of more than one monarch;
yet poverty was his prevailing lot, and his work was carried
on under a constant struggle with difficulties and obstacles
of the most serious character.</p>

<p>When we recall the limited extent of the circles of
students and readers in France and throughout Europe
who were interested in higher literature, the constant absorption
of the rulers and nobles and of the active-minded
citizens generally in war and in political strife to the
necessary exclusion of any adequate attention to the arts
of peace; and when, further, we remember the constant
succession of wars, civil and foreign, in which, during the
lifetime of our publisher, France was engaged, wars which
must have rendered all traffic difficult and have constituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
a most serious hindrance to the business of producing and
of distributing books, we can but be surprised at the number
and the magnitude of his literary and his business
achievements, and are prepared to accord full appreciation
to his courage, his patient persistence, his enormous industry,
and his omnivorous scholarship. It has been possible
in this article merely to touch upon some of the more noteworthy
of his own productions. The mere transcription
of the titles of the literary labours achieved or projected
by Henry would be a considerable task; and we gather
the impression that in his strength and capacity for continuous
work he must have as far exceeded the average
literary worker of to-day, as the heroes of old were said
to have exceeded in their physical powers the men of
later times. In comparing the character of Henry with
that of his father Robert, Maittaire says that they evinced
equal skill and zeal in their profession, but speaks of
Robert as less ostentatious of his own merits, more
ingenuous, and more ready to acknowledge the co-operation
of others. Greswell finds evidence of an arrogance
and moroseness of temper in Henry, which increased with
age, and which frequently led him into violent altercations.</p>

<p>Florence, the eldest daughter of Henry Estienne, had
married (in 1586) the famous scholar Isaac Casaubon, a
son-in-law of whom a father like Henry Estienne might
well have been proud. Mark Pattison, in his biography
of Casaubon, suggests that the latter had probably fallen
in love with the manuscript collections of the father before
he began to pay his court to the daughter. It was
fortunate for Casaubon that his wife proved satisfactory
in herself, as the jealousy of her father prevented him
from securing any benefit from the manuscript collections.
After a good deal of friction, Casaubon appears
to have given up the attempt to carry on scholarly work
with Estienne, and, according to Pattison, he never saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
inside of Estienne’s library, notwithstanding the absence
of the latter for months and even for years at a time, excepting
on one memorable occasion when he and Florence
summoned courage to break it open.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>According to Casaubon, Estienne was in fact a perfect
dragon in the close keeping of his books and manuscripts.
Speaking of a new book of Camerarius, Casaubon writes
to Bongars, “Read it I have not; seen it I have, but it
was in the hands of Henry Estienne who would not so
much as allow me to touch, much less to read it, while he
is every day using or abusing my books as if they were
his own.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Pattison goes on to point out, however, that
Casaubon exaggerates the facts, when he complains that
Estienne would lend him no books, as both with the
<i>Strabo</i> and with the <i>Athenæus</i>, he derived material assistance
from collations which Henry Estienne had made in
Italy.</p>

<p>Casaubon contributed also to certain of the editions
issued by his father-in-law, such as the <i>Thucydides</i> of 1588,
the Latin <i>Dionysius</i> of the same year, the <i>Plinius</i> of 1591,
and the <i>Diogenes Laertius</i> of 1593. According to his own
account, he was, however, jealously excluded from all
share in the text and the translation, or from any control
of the contents of the volumes, and his contributions
appear to have been limited to notes and commentaries.</p>

<p>Casaubon appears never to have secured from Estienne
the payment of a certain dower, that belonged to or had
been promised to his wife, while the portion of the
property that finally came to Florence after the settlement
of her father’s very meagre estate was but trifling and
was, later, more than offset by a claim for which the
estate was adjudged to be liable for the re-payment of
certain moneys that had been advanced, on the security
of the matrices of the famous royal font of Greek type,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>which had been brought by Robert Estienne from
Paris.</p>

<p>The business of the House of Estienne was carried on
after Henry’s death by his son Paul and his nephews.
The publications of these Estiennes of the fourth generation
were chiefly, as heretofore, in the division of Greek
and Roman classics, and were of a character fairly to
maintain the high scholarly standard which had been
established. Robert was himself a classicist and a poet,
and Maittaire speaks of his literary productions as having
secured a good repute.</p>

<p>Antoine, the son of Paul, succeeded his father in 1620,
and in 1623 was appointed <i>Imprimeur du Roy</i>. His son
Henry succeeded in 1649 to the latter title. Henry’s
work closed about 1659. He left no children, and was
the last of the family who devoted himself to the work of
printing and publishing, and with his death, therefore, the
history of the House comes to an end.</p>

<p>During a term of more than a century and a half the
Estiennes or Stephani had, as printers, as publishers, and
as scholars filled a large place in the literary history of
France and of Europe, and I find record of no other
family which has contributed to the profession of publishing
so many distinctive and distinguished men.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">Isaac Casaubon.</h3><p class="heading">—As a supplement to this sketch of
the history of the Estienne family, I will add a brief reference
to the literary work and the publishing relations
of Isaac Casaubon, the famous scholar, who, as above mentioned,
entered into the family circle as the son-in-law of
the second Henry.</p></div>

<p>In 1589, the city of Geneva was being besieged by the
Duke of Savoy. The siege continued, in form at least,
during the ensuing nine years, and although it was, of
course, not practicable during the whole of that period to
maintain a close investment, the city suffered all the privations
and many of the horrors of continued war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>

<p>Geneva contained in 1589, at the time of the beginning
of the siege, a population of about 12,000. It was able
to muster for its defence 2186 men capable of bearing
arms. Against this little force the Duke brought up an
army of 18,000 regular troops, with the determination to
destroy the nest of heretics once for all. The importance
of destroying the city was fully understood by the
Catholic party, and was especially urged by S. Francis de
Sales. The schools and the printing-presses were particularly
pointed out by the Saint as instruments of mischief.
The struggle against these odds was a gallant one,
but the little Republic succeeded in preserving its existence
and its independence, although when, by the peace of
Vervins in 1598, it was released from its state of siege,
it had lost out of its little levy nearly three fourths.</p>

<p>Isaac Casaubon, who, later, took rank as one of the
most learned scholars of his time, was born in Geneva in
1559. He was the son of Arnold Casaubon, a Protestant
pastor of Dauphiné. He held the Chair of Greek and of
History in the Academy of Geneva from 1581 to 1596, (a
term which included the period of the great siege) when
he migrated to Montpellier. Isaac’s salary as professor in
Geneva was two hundred and eighty florins, to which he
was able to add ninety florins from boarding students.
On this meagre income he ventured (in 1584) to marry a
wife and managed also to bring together a considerable
collection of books.</p>

<p>This first wife, who was a native of Geneva, died in two
years, leaving a daughter. In 1586, Casaubon took for
his second wife Florence, the daughter of Henry Estienne.</p>

<p>One of the manuscript-dealers with whom Casaubon, as
an impecunious collector, came into relations, was Darmarius,
described as one of the last of the caligraphs, a
class which in Italy and in the university towns of Germany
survived for nearly half a century the invention of
printing. Darmarius had access to the libraries of Venice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
and Florence and travelled about Europe to sell his
copies. His manuscripts, says Pattison, were not works
of art like the productions of the pen of a Vergecio or a
Rhosus, made to adorn the collections of princes and
cardinals. The books sold by Darmarius were hasty
transcripts, written on poor paper, chiefly of certain unpublished
works that he had found in the library of Cardinal
Bessarion.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> They did not make up for their want
of beauty by the accuracy of their text, for the transcriber
does not seem to have known even the grammar of classic
Greek, but for these wretched copies he was able to secure
from scholars hungry for books, great prices. For a
<i>Polyæmus</i>, Casaubon paid, in 1578, “a great sum,” <i>magno
ære</i>, and for a <i>Julius Africanus</i> three hundred crowns,
almost its weight in silver, but neither of these authors
was as yet in print.</p>

<p>The admission of Casaubon into the family of the great
publisher, so far from adding to his opportunities for getting
his writings before the public, did not even secure for
him any additional facilities for their preparation. Reference
has already been made in the sketch of Henry Estienne
to the jealous selfishness with which, particularly in the
later years of his life, he retained in his own hands his
collections of books and of manuscripts. But few friends
appear to have ever secured from him permission to
utilise his literary stores, while of his learned son-in-law
he was particularly jealous. Casaubon was one of the
few scholars in Europe who was competent to edit, from
the original, a Greek text, and although in certain respects
Estienne’s scholarly ideals were high, he seems to
have laid more stress upon his individual prestige than
upon the advance of learning.</p>

<p>Impecunious as Casaubon was during by far the greater
portion of his life, he appears to have been always ready
to give orders or commissions for the purchase of books
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>or manuscripts. In some cases he was able to arrange to
pay for these by services in one direction or another; in
1592, for instance, Henricus Petri of Basel sends him two
copies of his second edition of <i>Homer</i>, one for the King
of France and one for himself, the gift being accompanied
with the request that Casaubon would secure for the book
a (copyright) privilege for France.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In 1608, Biondi of
Venice has a standing commission to send books to
Casaubon.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Many presents of manuscripts were made to
Casaubon, and in other instances manuscripts and books
were loaned to him which were never returned. Pattison
speaks of this part of Casaubon’s collection as becoming
his by “process of adhesion.” In 1595, Casaubon writes
to Commelin, a publisher of Heidelberg, as follows:</p>

<p>“If I ask you to send me direct all that issues from
your press, it is not, believe me, dearest Commelin, because
I am unwilling to buy these, but because I am
unable. Our booksellers here in Geneva are a blind sort,
who are unwilling to bring back from Frankfort any books
that may not pay. I except Favre, who is not so stupid
as the rest. You will have to write to De Tournes [a
printer of Geneva] directing him to deliver to me the
<i>Chrysostom</i>, as he refuses to do so without your express
commands.” Casaubon’s complaint about the lack of
enterprise on the part of the booksellers of Geneva has,
of course, been frequently enough repeated by scholars of
later date, who are not always able to understand that the
bookseller who takes unwise risks in accumulating stock
that may not sell, will very soon cease to be a bookseller
at all. His annoyance at De Tournes for declining to
hand over property of Commelin’s without authority from
the owner is equally naïve.</p>

<p>Casaubon tells us that Geneva in his day had a public
library, but that the collection, although valuable, was very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>small. The <i>Commentaries</i> published by Casaubon in 1592,
on Perseus, Theophrastus, Suetonius, and Diogenes Laertius,
were based upon the lectures given by him in the Geneva
Academy. The volumes were printed in Geneva, but
I can find no record of the arrangement made by him of
their publication. The references that he makes to the
several sources of his very small income include no mention
of receipts from the sale of his books, and it seems
probable that these brought to their author no returns
other than the occasional expression of recognition or
honorarium on the part of scholarly patrons. If Henry
Estienne had been willing to give to these <i>Commentaries</i>
the service of the imprint of his Paris House, the commercial
results would probably have been much more satisfactory,
but, whatever the difficulty, it was the case that
no writings of Casaubon were issued by his father-in-law.</p>

<p>Casaubon tells us that the ministers of Geneva exercised
a strict surveillance over the teaching both of the
scholar and of the Academy, and that a professor in the
latter could not even publish without first submitting his
book to the censorship of divines. It seems probable
that the Calvinistic scrutiny in Geneva may easily have
been in its narrowness and in its persistency a more
serious obstacle during the last ten years of the sixteenth
century, in the way of publishing and literary undertakings,
than the censorship of the Catholic theologians
of Paris.</p>

<p>It is the conclusion of Pattison (which is not in harmony
with the earlier descriptions of the intellectual activities
of Geneva) that during the term of Casaubon’s work there
existed in the town nothing that could properly be called
a literary interest. There was a poor and starved seminary
for pious instruction; an academic printing-press
devoted to the production of sermons and text-books; a
theology not formal or nominal, but interfused throughout
the life and the thought of each day. An armed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
enemy crouched at the gates of the city, watching his opportunity
for the death spring; while each week brought
news of some fresh outrage on believers with whom
Geneva was in sympathy in the countries where the Catholic
reaction was in its full tide.</p>

<p>On this ungenial soil, Casaubon developed out of his
own instincts the true ideal of classical learning. Not a
scheme of philology, as we now conceive it, but the idea
of a complete mastery, by exhaustive reading, of the
thought of the ancient world, a reconstruction of
Greek and Roman antiquity out of the extant remains of
the literature.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Casaubon’s first literary work of importance,
the <i>Animadversiones</i> on Athenæus, was printed at
Lyons in the year 1600. He was at the time occupying
a Chair in the Protestant University of Montpellier, but
there was no press in Montpellier with facilities for printing
Greek text. In fact, the printing of books in the city
appears to have begun only in 1597. Seventy years earlier,
Rabelais had been obliged to have printed at Lyons
his edition of the <i>Hypocratic Aphorisms</i>. Casaubon endeavoured
to induce a Geneva printer to establish in Montpellier
a Press with a Greek font and a skilled corrector,
but the business connected with the little University did
not offer sufficient encouragement for the undertaking.
It may be remembered that Oxford did not possess any
Greek type until 1586, and that Greek was first printed in
Cambridge some years later. Pattison is of opinion that
there was probably at the time a Greek Press at Toulouse,
but no heretic could print or even sojourn in this
city of fanatical Romanism, a city in which even the edict
of toleration could never be put in force.</p>

<p>What Casaubon would, of course, have preferred and
what ought, through his father-in-law, to have been secured
for him, was the advantage of the Greek Press of Paris,
which, during the previous half-century, had secured for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>itself a well-earned pre-eminence. For the impecunious
professor a journey to Paris was, however, at this time,
out of the question, and he was obliged to content himself
with a provincial publisher. Of the book-trade of the
French provinces, Lyons was at that time the centre.
In facilities for reaching the book markets of Switzerland
and Germany, it had advantages over Paris itself.
Its connections with Italy were, of course, very much
more direct than those possessed by the publishers
of Paris, and it utilised these connections not
only for the prompt importation of the publications of
France, of Florence, and of Rome, but for the reproduction,
often in pretty close fac-simile, of the more noteworthy
books issued from the Italian presses. With the
smaller outlay requisite in reprinting works upon which
the expense of editing and preparing for the press had
already been covered, the publishers of Lyons were able
to undersell Aldus and his successors and to secure for
the Aldine texts a large part of the returns from the markets
of southern Europe. They did not even limit their
“appropriations” to the productions of foreign publishers,
such as Aldus of Venice, Froben of Basel, and Koberger
of Nuremberg. We find continual record of complaints
on the part of the publishers of Paris that their “privileges”
were not respected and that their more marketable
books were reproduced by their piratical competitors in
Lyons. The “enterprise” of the publishers in Lyons
seems not even to have been restricted by their relations
with the Catholic Church, for they built up a trade in the
production of Calvinistic hymn-books for the use of the
congregations of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The printers of Geneva, who were naturally of the
opinion that Calvinism was their legitimate stock in trade
and should be for them an exclusive possession, equally
unmindful of their denominational obligations, retorted
by manufacturing cheap editions of missals, books of hours,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
and even of Jesuit publications. The Lyonese printers
availed themselves of the brand of heretic to secure the
confiscation at the frontier of a good many shipments of
the books from Geneva even when these books belonged
to “orthodox” Jesuit literature. The Genevese could
not easily meet this weapon, as there was at that time in
force in the Republic no <i>index expurgatorius</i>, and there was,
therefore, no means of securing an examination of books
on the frontier. They continued, however, their invasion
of the French market after peace had been restored between
France and the Republic, and they managed to
evade the prohibition or the restriction upon the importation
of books printed in the Protestant city of Geneva, by
placing upon their title-pages the name of some other
publishing centre, such as Cologne or Antwerp. Occasionally
even, the name of a French city was substituted
for the obnoxious Geneva. For instance, the edition of
<i>Aristotle</i>, printed in 1590 by Le Maire of Geneva, had
upon it the title <i>Lugdunæ</i> (Lyons).</p>

<p>Henry Estienne died at Lyons in January, 1598, and
Casaubon, on his way to Geneva, to look after the settlement
of his wife’s interest in the estate, stopped at Lyons.
He found there, in the person of a certain Meric de Vic, a
patron who was willing to co-operate with him in the publication
of the <i>Animadversiones</i>, and who, afterwards, gave
him the means of making his visit to Paris. In later years,
De Vic was known as a friend and patron of Grotius. I
have been able to find no exact record of the arrangement
with the Lyons publisher. The work was printed for the
account of the author, by Antoine de Harsy, the cost
being in large part provided by De Vic.</p>

<p>Pattison speaks of De Harsy as “one of those cormorants
who about this time began to sit hard by the tree
of knowledge,”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but he does not give us the evidence for
this unfavourable estimate. He goes on to say, as if in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>mitigation of his harsh description of Casaubon’s first
publisher, that up to this time the publisher had usually
been the friend of the author, and often his collaborator,
even when not an author in his own name.</p>

<p>In arriving at Geneva, after the death of Estienne,
Casaubon entered, only for the second time in his life, his
father-in-law’s library. “Such a wreck of vast projects!
A memorial of stupendous labour!” he exclaimed, on
seeing it. We learn from his diary that it was due to his
influence that the co-heirs permitted the manuscripts to
pass to Paul Estienne, to whom the Greek Press had been
bequeathed. The printed books were sold for the benefit
of the creditors. Such a termination of the scholarly
labours and enormous energy of Estienne was hardly to
have been looked for.</p>

<p>In the year 1600, at the instance of his friend De Vic,
Casaubon journeyed to Paris, where he was hoping to
receive from the King some kind of appointment that
would secure him an income. He was received for a time
as the guest of his wife’s cousin, Henry Estienne. The
publishing business of the old House of Estienne was
then being carried on in Paris by the Patissons, who had
connected themselves with the family by marriage.</p>

<p>The position which Casaubon understood from De Vic
had been promised by the King was not secured without
discouraging delay. He had hoped to be associated in
some way with the instruction of Greek in the University,
but his Protestant faith proved an insuperable obstacle to
any University appointment. In 1601, after he had been
kept waiting nearly a year, a royal patent was given to
him as keeper of the Royal Library, where he succeeded
the mathematician Gosselin. The salary was 1,200 livres,
and the duties of the post left to the incumbent a large
measure of leisure time.</p>

<p>The Paris of that day contained about 400,000 people.
Coryat, writing in 1608, says that the Rue S. Jacques<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
was “very full of booksellers that have faire shoppes most
plentifully furnished with bookes.” The library in which
the scholar from Geneva now found himself installed contained
about nine hundred works, a large proportion of
which were in manuscript. The collection of Greek manuscripts
was said to be second only to that of the Vatican.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The new librarian found himself in favour with the
King, who visited the library from time to time and made
gracious inquiries of the keeper concerning the contents
of the books. It was said by Scaliger of Henry IV. that
he could not keep his countenance and could not read a
book. Moderate as was the salary of the keeper of the
King’s books, it was, by not a few of those in authority
in a Court where literature was held in such low esteem,
considered to be a wasteful and excessive expenditure.
“You cost the King too much, Sir,” said Sully to Casaubon;
“your pay exceeds that of two good captains, and
you are of no use to the country.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Casaubon’s position in Paris proved, after a few years,
to be an impossible one. It had, it seems, been the expectation
of the King that his librarian would, for the
sake of remaining in Paris, follow the royal example and
accept (in form at least) the faith of Rome. This course
the student from Geneva had, however, no idea of taking.
The opposition of the theologians of the University and
of the politicians of the Court (including the great minister
Sully) proved in the end sufficient to withdraw from
the librarian the King’s favour, and Casaubon foresaw
that he could not be assured of the continuance of the
royal protection. At the invitation of some scholarly
English friends—Spottswood, later, Archbishop of Glasgow,
and Lamb, afterwards Bishop of Galway,—Casaubon
went to London, ostensibly for a visit. He was presented
to King James, whose ambition to be recognised as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>member of the fraternity of European scholars induced
him to offer to Casaubon a pension of three hundred
pounds if he would make his home in England. The
offer was accepted, and the remaining years of Casaubon’s
life were spent in London, with an occasional sojourn in
Ely, where his good friend, Bishop Andrews, was always
ready to tender appreciative hospitality.</p>

<p>One of the famous controversial publications of the
latter half of the sixteenth century was the series entitled
the <i>Magdeburg Centuries</i>. The purpose of the Lutheran
writers of this work was to present a true history of the
Church of Christ. According to this Protestant view,
the Church had been instituted in the Apostolic age in
perfect purity, but had been perverted by a process of
slow canker, until it had become the Church, not of Christ
but of Anti-Christ, an instrument not for saving men, but
for destroying them. The <i>Centuries</i> were completed, in
1574, in no less than thirteen folio volumes. It was evident
that, for a work of this compass, no wide circulation
could be looked for with the impecunious public of Protestant
Germany, but the historical thesis of which these
folios were the laborious evidence made a deep impression
upon the thought of the time.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>A young priest named Baronius was selected by the
authorities in Rome, or rather by S. Philip Neri, to prepare
a reply to the <i>Centuries</i>, and he devoted his life to
the task. The result was the production of the <i>Annales
Ecclesiastici</i>, the most comprehensive work which the
controversies of the Protestant revolt had as yet produced.
The <i>Annales</i> were completed, as far as the work of
Baronius was concerned, in thirteen folio volumes, in 1600,
but the series was continued by various writers until, in
the edition issued at Lucca in 1738-1786, it had grown to
thirty-eight folio volumes, a work of which purchase was
difficult and perusal impossible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>
<p>Of the original work, the circulation, considering the
bulk and the costliness of the volumes, was unprecedented.
The printing was done at the Papal Press, the same press
which had originally been organised by Paul Manutius.
The cost was borne by the papal treasury and the full
weight of the authority of the influence of the Church was
given to securing the widest possible distribution. As a
result, edition after edition was taken off by the demands
from the libraries of the monasteries, the cathedral chapters,
and the Jesuit colleges and also by individual prelates
and princes, who had remained in the orthodox fold.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The amount of the original labour put into the book by
Baronius must have been enormous, as his texts, his notes,
and even his extracts were all made with his own hand.
According to his own statement, the continuous labour
could never have been supported, had it not been in the
first place for the stimulating authority of S. Philip Neri,
and secondly for the special aid given by the Virgin, the
saints, and the apostles Peter and Paul. Pattison sums up
the purpose and the result of the work as follows: “Baronius
exhibited the visible unity and impeccable purity
of the Church founded upon Peter and handed down inviolate;
such at this day as it had ever been ... the
<i>Annales</i> transferred to the Catholic party the preponderance
in the field of learning, which ever since Erasmus had
been on the side of the innovators.”</p>

<p>It was the turn of the Protestants to feel the need of
an antidote to Baronius and an attempt to supply this
need was made in the <i>Exercitationes</i> of Casaubon. Casaubon’s
work, however, never passed beyond the status of
a fragment, although this fragment was sufficiently ponderous
to form eight hundred folio pages. According to
the Protestant authorities, Casaubon had no difficulty in
showing the great lack of accurate scholarship on the part
of Baronius and in pointing out in the earlier portions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>the <i>Annales</i> (it was only the first two volumes that were
considered in his <i>Exercitationes</i>) an enormous number of
errors and misstatements. It was in fact difficult to understand
how the task of writing the early history of the
Church could have been undertaken (even with the aid of
S. Peter and S. Paul) by an author who was ignorant both
of Greek and of Hebrew. The volume of <i>Exercitationes</i>
did not, however, secure any such general circulation or
wide-spread influence with Protestant readers as had been
gained among the Catholics by the great series of <i>Annales</i>.
There was no ecclesiastical authority to induce the purchase
as an act of piety and no ecclesiastical machinery
available to further circulation.</p>

<p>These three works seemed to me to call for some special
reference, because they present noteworthy and characteristic
examples of the theological controversies of the century
and of the employment of scholarly labour to secure
or to affirm the foundations of religious faith. The very
great advantages possessed by the Roman writer in securing
immediate channels of distribution and an assured
reading public are also to be noted in connection with the
serious obstacles existing at the time in the way of any
general distribution of books by means of such machinery
as was available for the publishers.</p>

<p>The <i>Exercitationes</i> was printed for Casaubon by the
King’s printer in London and was issued by a publisher
named Bell. I can find no record of the publishing arrangement,
but the cost of the undertaking appears to have been
provided for in part by the royal treasury and in part by
the aid of Bishop Andrews, who was an old friend of the
author.</p>

<p>Casaubon’s sojourn in England was more favourable for
his literary labour than had been his position as royal
librarian in Paris, but while he was the most industrious
of students, and, according to his biographies, practically
killed himself by close application to his desk, the number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
of his completed works is but inconsiderable. Pattison
gives the titles or descriptions of not less than twenty-four
books, which had been planned out and many of which
had been in part written, but which remained at the death
of the scholar either fragments or simply titles.</p>

<p>Of the twenty-five works that were finished during the
lifetime of the scholar, a portion were afterwards characterised
by himself as <i>juvenilia</i> which he was unwilling
even to acknowledge. The edition of <i>Theophrastus</i>, published
in 1592, is the first work with which in later years
Casaubon expressed himself as satisfied. No one of the
books appears to have retained for itself a literary life,
that is to say, to have become a part of the world’s literature
or even to have remained in demand with the scholars.
It was the case with Casaubon, as with Scaliger, that his
reputation has remained greater than that of his productions.
The scholar was more important than his books.
It seems evident, as far as can be gathered from the scanty
references to business details in Casaubon’s correspondence,
that he never earned anything, at least directly, through
the labours of his pen. His books must all have produced
deficiencies instead of profits, and the sum required for
their publication had to be obtained from the few wealthy
friends who were able to appreciate the value to the world
of a life devoted to scholarship.</p>

<p>Casaubon died in London in 1614, in his 55th year.</p>

<p class="center">WILLIAM CAXTON, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF
PRINTING INTO ENGLAND, 1422-1492.</p>
</div>

<p class="noin dropcap">A SKETCH of the early printer-publishers of Europe
would of course be incomplete without some reference
to the career of the man whose work will
always be associated with the history of printing in England.
The publishing undertakings of Caxton were, however,
of much less considerable importance than those of
his continental contemporaries to whom chapters have
been devoted, while it is also the case that the events of
his life have been so fully set forth in various English
histories that they are already familiar to readers interested
in the record of printing and publishing. It would,
therefore, be superfluous for me to attempt to present, in
a general sketch like the present, any extended or detailed
information concerning Caxton’s career. For my present
purpose, it will be sufficient to indicate briefly the influences
from which Caxton derived his interest in literary
undertakings, and the sources from which he secured his
training as a printer, with some reference to the character
of his publishing undertakings as compared with those of
the printers whose work had already been begun in Germany,
France, and Italy.</p>

<p>Caxton was born in the Weald of Kent, about 1422,
and died in London in 1492. His life covered, therefore,
the period during which Gutenberg was perfecting his
printing-press, and included also the years in which Koberger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
was beginning his publishing work in Nuremberg
and Froben was organising his publishing concern in Basel.
The first publication of Aldus in Venice was issued in the
year after the death of Caxton. While the larger number
of the early printers had had training in technical
or mechanical work, which secured for them a certain
preparation for the technical requirements of the new art,
and others, as in the case of Aldus, had had experience as
students and as instructors which gave them advantages
for the editorial work of scholarly publishing, the larger
proportion of the active life of Caxton had been devoted
to business as a wool-merchant, in connection with which
business he could, at least in his earlier years, have had
but few opportunities for coming into relations with men
interested in literature. His literary interests came to him
comparatively late in life, as a result of his association with
the Court of the Duke of Burgundy, while his first knowledge
of and attraction towards the work of printing were
the result of the acquaintance formed at that Court with
Colard Mansion, the first printer of Bruges.</p>

<p>Caxton’s business work began as an apprentice to
Robert Large, who was an eminent member of the Mercers’
Company of London. It is the conclusion of Mr.
Blades, who has made himself the authority on the subject
of Caxton, that the admission of the young Kentishman
to such a household as that of Large was in itself sufficient
evidence, under the conditions of the time, that
Caxton was a man of good family. It is Mr. Blades’s
belief that Caxton was a descendant of the Caunstons,
who owned the manor of Caunston in the Weald.</p>

<p>In 1441, when Caxton was about twenty years old, his
first master died and he was sent to Bruges, where he became
a member of the English <i>House</i> or the English
<i>Nation</i>, the term applied to the association of English
merchants residing in Bruges, and carrying on from there
business with England and with the other trade centres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of the Continent. His early associations had given him
some preparation for a sojourn in Flanders. A colony of
Flemish wool-manufacturers had been established in the
Weald by Edward III., and the Flemings, having inter-married
with the Kentish families, had impressed their
language and their social habits very largely upon that
portion of the county. Of the English <i>Nation</i> in Bruges
Caxton became governor, in or about 1462, a position
which made him the leading Englishman in the dominions
of Burgundy. His selection for such a position confirms
the impression that he was a man of birth, while it was
also evidence that he had been successful in his business
undertakings and that he was recognised as a man of
character and of executive ability.</p>

<p>His position brought him into official relations with the
Court of Burgundy and with the new Duke, Charles the
Bold, who, in 1467, succeeded his father, Philip the Good.
Princess Margaret of England, the sister of King Edward
IV., who became the wife of Charles, seems to have taken
a keen, personal interest in Caxton, and, a year or two
after her coming to Bruges, she induced him to give up
his mercantile career and his honourable position as governor
of the English merchants and to attach himself to
her personal service. Lord Scales, afterward Earl Rivers,
who had visited Bruges as one of the ambassadors to conclude
the treaty of marriage, was, later, one of the most
liberal patrons of Caxton the printer, and his translation
of the <i>Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers</i> was the first
book with the date of imprint issued from Caxton’s London
Press.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>After 1467, while Caxton still held his official responsibilities
and before he had begun to investigate the new
art of printing, we find him interesting himself in literary
pursuits. He began in that year the translation of the
<i>Histories of Troy</i> (<i>Le Recueil des Histoires de Troye</i>), which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>translation was printed in 1474. In 1471, Caxton was in the
service of the Duchess, receiving a yearly salary and other
advantages, and being under instruction to proceed with
his literary undertakings. Margaret seems, in fact, in
giving Caxton an income in order that he might devote
himself to literature, to have had in view a kind of endowment
of research. He presented to the Duchess, in 1471,
as a first result of his literary labours, a manuscript copy
of his now completed translation of the <i>Histoires</i>, and the
favour given by her to the work appears to have secured
for it an immediate reputation, not only with the English-speaking
members of the Court, but with their friends
and correspondents in England, so that demand for
Caxton’s translation soon became more active than could
be supplied by the work of the scribe. In the epilogue
to the first printed edition, he speaks of his hand becoming
“wery and not stedfast with much writing” while his eyes
were “dimed with overmuch lokyng on the whit paper.”
Then it was, apparently, that, through the suggestion of
his friend Colard Mansion, he was led to turn his attention
to the new art of printing.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>As has been mentioned in an earlier chapter, literary
interests had, for a number of years before the beginning
of printing, found a favourable environment in the
dominions of the Duke of Burgundy. Burgundy and
Flanders were, during the last half of the fifteenth century,
among the richest territories in Europe. The arts
and the luxuries of civilisation had at that time attained
a higher development in Bruges than in almost any other
capital, and with the other refinements of life, had come
an active interest in literary pursuits and in the collection
of libraries. These literary interests had been furthered
by the example of the ruling family, successive dukes
having set the fashion of collecting rare and costly works
and of employing great staffs of skilled scribes, illuminators,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>and binders, to put into the most beautiful possible
dress the manuscripts that had been secured from all parts
of Europe. David Aubert, a well-known scribe, writing in
1457, thus describes the literary interests of Duke Philip
the Good: “This renowned and virtuous prince has been
accustomed, for many years past, to have ancient histories
read to him daily. His library surpasses all others, for
from his youth he has had in his service numerous translators,
scholars, historians, and scribes, working diligently
not only in Bruges but in various countries, so that
now there is not in all christendom a prince who has so
varied and rich a collection.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Barrois, in describing the library of this sovereign, gives
(as a selection only) the titles of nearly three thousand
works, the greater part being magnificent folios, written
on vellum, beautifully illuminated, and bound in velvet,
satin, or damask. Many of the volumes were studded
with gems, and were fastened with gold clasps, jewelled
or chased.</p>

<p>The fashion set by the Court was followed by the opulent
nobles, and, later, by the wealthy merchants, who
vied with each other in multiplying libraries. A nobleman
whose name became famous in connection with literature
was Louis de Bruges, Seigneur de la Gruthuyse,
who afterwards received from Edward IV. of England
the title of Earl of Winchester. The larger portion of
his manuscripts were the work of Flemish scribes and
were decorated by Flemish artists. His library afterwards
came into possession of the kings of France, being
added to the collection of the Chateau of Blois. A number
of the manuscripts are now preserved in the <i>Bibliothèque
Nationale</i> of Paris. The Flemish armorial bearings
had been partly obliterated in order to be replaced with
those of the French King, but the obliteration was not so
complete as to prevent the identification of the manuscripts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>with the original collection of Louis. It was to
Louis de Bruges that Colard Mansion owed the first
assistance he secured in the attempt (which was finally
unsuccessful) to establish a printing concern in Bruges.
It is somewhat surprising, in consideration of the great
wealth of the Flemish capital, the large measure of literary
interest shown by its noblemen and its merchants,
the extensive collections of beautiful and accurate manuscripts
available for the use of the printers, and the exceptional
trade facilities and connections possessed by a
city which was at the time the commercial capital of
North Europe, that the art of printing should not at once
have secured an assured foothold, and that some printer
should not have built up in the Flemish capital a successful
publishing concern. The first publishers who did
secure an assured business foundation and a wide-spread
literary prestige were obliged to do their work under conditions
which appeared to be much less favourable than
those existing in 1470 at Bruges. Bruges was probably
the first city in Europe which possessed, some years before
the beginning of printing, a guild of makers of books,
the organisation of which was entirely on a mercantile
basis, that is to say, which had no connection with any
university and was under no other supervision or control
than that of the monarch. The company, which in 1454
received a formal charter, is styled <i>Der Ghilde van sinte
jan Ewagz</i>, or the Guild of S. John the Evangelist, who
was the patron saint of scribes. The branches of industry
connected with book-making which were represented in
this guild are specified by Van Praet as follows: scriveners,
illuminators, printers (that is to say, those who produced
from blocks impressions of illustrations), parchment
and vellum makers, letter engravers, figure engravers,
carvers, cloth shearers, curriers, bookbinders, painters,
vignette designers, print sellers, booksellers.</p>

<p>In Antwerp a similar guild, instituted at about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
same time, was called the Guild of S. Luke; while at
Brussels the scriveners instituted a limited guild of their
own, called <i>Les Frères de la Plume</i>. It is to be borne in
mind that there was in England no guild of writers or
makers of books until a number of years after the introduction
of printing, the charter of the Stationers’ Company
dating from 1552.</p>

<p>It was the good fortune of Caxton to be for thirty-three
years a resident of the city which could divide with
Paris the distinction of being the literary capital of North
Europe, and for the latter portion of that time, in his
close association with the Court, to have had access to
the ducal libraries and the other great collections of the
city. Mr. Blades is of opinion that, in the course of his
mercantile business, Caxton must often have had occasion
to fill commissions, from correspondents in England who
were interested in literature, for transcripts of Flemish
manuscripts. If this be the case, he became a connecting
link between his native country and the literary treasures
of the continent a number of years before he began in
London the work of printing for English readers his own
versions of the Flemish manuscripts.</p>

<p>Of the history of Colard Mansion, the first printer of
Bruges, but few details have been preserved. He is
known to have been a skilled scribe, and one of the earliest
references to him occurs in 1450, when there is record
of his receiving from Duke Philip fifty-four livres for the
manuscript of a romance entitled <i>Romuleon</i>, which was
illuminated and bound in velvet. This copy is now in
the Royal Library at Brussels.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> From 1454 to 1473,
Mansion’s name is found in the list of subscribers to the
Guild of S. John, and, in or about the year 1471, he removed
from Brussels to Bruges, and devoted himself to
the work of printing. In 1484, he appears to have broken
down in resources and in credit. He left Bruges, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>after that time nothing further is known of him. He was
at the time in arrears to the chapter of S. Donatus for
the rent of his printing-office, the work of which he had
carried on in two rooms over the porch of the church, but
the value of the printed sheets left in the rooms appears
to have been sufficient to liquidate this debt. Van Praet
speaks of twenty-one works as having been printed by
him, while Blades finds record of twenty-two. Of these,
the most important was probably the edition of Ovid’s
<i>Metamorphoses</i>, printed in French, in a large folio, with
numerous woodcuts. The practice of adorning books
with illustrations and with ornate initials and tail-pieces
remained a characteristic of the Press of the Low Countries.
Other noteworthy works on the list were French
editions of <i>Boëthius</i> and <i>Boccaccio</i>. With the exception
of one work, <i>Dionysii Areopagiticæ liber</i>, all of Mansion’s
publications were in French. In this respect he forms a
noteworthy exception to the printers of his generation,
whose earlier works were nearly exclusively in Latin.
One or two of the first printers in Lyons also began their
work with volumes in French. Mansion’s undertakings
were divided nearly equally between books of devotion
and books of frivolity, such as <i>Les Advineaux Amoureux</i>,
the only volume on the list which reached a second edition.
The opinion of Mr. Blades, that the fonts of type
used by Mansion were identical with those later employed
in the first books of Caxton, may, I judge, be considered
as established.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>It is the contention of the German historians that
Caxton secured his training as a printer not in Bruges
but in Cologne, and that the initiative for the introduction
of printing into England is, therefore, to be credited
to Germany. The evidence for and against this theory,
evidence which depends largely upon technical details,
such as the identity of certain fonts of type, the spacing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>of lines, etc., has been very thoroughly and skilfully
analysed by Mr. Blades, and his conclusion, that Caxton
did no work in the Cologne printing-offices and that his
first printed books did not follow the Cologne models,
can, I judge, be safely accepted. Some reference to the
grounds for the German belief may, however, be made.
Printing had been introduced into Cologne by Ulrich
Zell, who was a fugitive from the sack of Mayence. His
first publication, or at least his first book with a date, was
the <i>Liber Joannis Chrysostomi super Psalmo quinquagesimo</i>,
issued in 1466. His second undertaking was an edition
of the <i>De Officiis</i> of Cicero. He printed in all no less
than one hundred and twenty separate works, and was
the leading printer in the city at the time of Caxton’s
visit in 1471. In connection with his business as a wool-merchant
and his official responsibilities for the English
<i>Nation</i>, Caxton had had continued relations with Cologne,
and must have had a full acquaintance with the city.
Madden speaks of Caxton as being a visitor, in 1470, at the
Weidenbach convent of the Brothers of Common Life in
Cologne, at which time the Brothers had their printing-office
in active operation.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Caxton’s diary tells us that
the translation of his <i>Recueil</i>, begun in Bruges and continued
in Ghent, was completed at Cologne on the 19th
of September, 1471. Kapp concludes that his first idea
for reproducing his translation in printed copies most
probably came to him from an examination of the work
of the presses of Zell or of the Brothers. It is of course
possible enough that Caxton interested himself, while in
Cologne in 1471, in inspecting the printing establishment
of Zell, which must, as a novelty, have been one of the
noteworthy sights of the city. It seems evident, however,
from Mr. Blades’s analysis of the fonts of type used
by Mansion and, later, by Caxton, that these were not
secured from Cologne, but were cast in Bruges, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>various details of the workmanship of Caxton’s earlier
volumes show methods entirely different from those of
the Cologne printers. As one such detail, Mr. Blades
points out that Zell, after 1467, always spaced out the
lines of his books to one even length, and feels convinced
that he would have taught any one learning the art from
him to do the same; yet this improvement was not
adopted by either Mansion or Caxton until several years
later. “Whoever may have been the instructor of Mansion
and Caxton, and whatever may have been the origin
of their typography, the opinion that either of them, after
learning the art in an advanced school such as that of
Cologne, would have adopted in their first productions,
without any necessity for so doing, primitive customs
which they had never been taught, and would have
returned in after years by slow degrees to the rules of
their original tuition, has only to be plainly stated to
render it untenable.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The chief information concerning Caxton’s training as
a printer is derived from his own <i>Prologues</i> and <i>Epilogues</i>.
The first six books ascribed to Caxton’s Press are:</p>

<ul>
<li>“The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye.” </li>
<li>“Le Recueil des Histoires de Troye.” </li>
<li>“The Game and Playe of Chesse, with Prologue by Caxton.” </li>
<li>“The Meditacions sur les Sept Pseaulmes Penitenceaux.”</li> 
<li>“Les Fais et Processes du Chevalier Jason.”</li> 
<li>“Les Quatre Dernières Choses Advenir.”</li> 
</ul>

<p>Without going into the careful analysis presented by
Blades of the evidence concerning the production of these
books, it is sufficient to give his conclusions. The <i>Recueil</i>,
with the translation of which Caxton had begun his literary
undertakings, was probably first printed (in Caxton’s
version) in 1474, and the edition of the French original
must have followed shortly afterwards. The remaining
four books were brought before the public between this
date and 1476.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>
<p>It is interesting to note the character of the selections
made by Caxton for the first issues of his Press. With
the exception of the <i>Meditations on the Psalms</i>, this group
of books belongs entirely to what to-day would be called
light literature. The same general character obtains with
the books printed by Mansion, and, excepting with one
or two Houses in Lyons, it could not be paralleled by the
lists of any other of the printers of this generation, whose
first undertakings were almost exclusively devoted to the
service of the Church or to the revival of the classics.
How far the responsibility for the literary standard of the
two printers of Bruges rested with themselves, and how
far it was determined by the preferences and suggestions
of their patroness the Duchess, it is probably not now
practicable to determine.</p>

<p>The German printers, Heynlin and Fichet, who introduced
printing into Paris, and their successors, Krantz,
Gering, and others, beginning their work under the instructions
of the University, had printed the books which
were selected for them by the University authorities, and
these earlier issues of the Paris Press were restricted to
theology and jurisprudence. Later, were added the
works of certain selected classic authors. It was a number
of years, however, before any volume was printed in
Paris in the French language. The first volume printed
in French in Europe was, in fact, Caxton’s edition of the
Burgundian romance, <i>Le Recueil</i>. The first French books
printed in France were issued in Lyons, where the publishers
were free from the hampering supervision of the
theologians of the University. The early Lyons lists of
the fifteenth century included indeed a series of quite
frivolous publications, in the vernacular, such as <i>Le Roman
de la Rose</i>, <i>La Farce de <span class ="err" title="original: Pathelie">Pathelin</span></i>, <i>Les Quinze Joies de
Mariage</i>, <i>Le Champion des Dames</i>, and a French version
of the <i>Facetiæ</i> of Poggio. The publishers of Paris, working
under the restrictions of the University censors, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
not infrequently have looked with envy at the publishing
undertakings of their enterprising Lyons competitors,
who were, with the exception of Caxton, the first to
address themselves to the tastes and to the interests of
the unscholarly and pleasure-seeking readers. In the
matter of cultivating and supplying a taste for popular
literature, Mansion and Caxton were in accord with the
methods of Lyons rather than those of Paris.</p>

<p>It is the conclusion of Mr. Blades that the books above
specified, while nominally issued by Caxton, were actually
printed by Mansion. However this may be, it is
evident that, in connection with the production of these
books, Caxton secured a sufficient knowledge of the
technicalities of the art to be qualified to carry on a
printing-office himself. It is probable that the ready
sale found in England for the printed copies of the <i>Recueil</i>
which were sent over there gave him encouragement
concerning the possibilities of the English market for
similar printed books. It is certain that, in 1476, he gave
up his home in Bruges, resigning at the same time the
honours and privileges pertaining to his position at Court,
and, retiring to England, established himself at Westminster.
The type, and probably also the presses, taken
over for his Westminster office, were those of Mansion,
which had become the property of Caxton, doubtless
through purchase from Mansion’s creditors. It was during
the fifteen years that remained to him of active work
after his varied life experience as an apprentice, a merchant,
a governor of a great mercantile colony, a magistrate,
and a courtier, that he was able to complete the
undertakings with which his name will always be associated,
and to bring to his native country the most important
result produced by the activity of man during
the noteworthy fifteenth century.</p>

<p>In the advertisement or announcement of his business,
issued by Caxton about 1480, he professes himself ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to satisfy any man, whether spiritually or temporally inclined.
The wording of the advertisement is as follows:</p>

<p>“If it plese any man spirituel or temporel to bye ony
pyes of two and thre <i>comemoracios</i> of Salisburi ose emprynted
after the forme of this present lettre whiche ben
and truly correct, late hym come to Westmenester in to
the almonesrye at the reed pale and he shall have them
good chepe.”</p>

<p>The phrase “printed in the Abbey of Westminster,”
which is affixed to some of the books, is not to be understood
as indicating that the work of the printing-office
was actually carried on within the walls of the church
itself. The tenement occupied by Caxton, called the
“red pale,” was in the almonry, this being a space within
the abbey precincts, where alms were distributed to the
poor. In the same enclosure were other buildings, including
the almshouses built by Lady Margaret, the
mother of Henry VII., who was one of Caxton’s patronesses.
Some chroniclers have suggested that the <i>scriptorium</i>
of the abbey would have been a very appropriate
place in which to begin the work of producing printed
books for England. One difficulty with this suggestion
is the lack of evidence that the abbey had ever contained
a <i>scriptorium</i>. No mention of such a place is made by
any historian, nor does any existing manuscript bear
record of having been produced within the abbey. Caxton’s
immediate successor, Wynken de Worde, who had
been his assistant, continued for some years after Caxton’s
death to carry on the work of the printing-office in the
same building. He placed on his books, for the Latin
form of imprint, the words, “In domo Caxton in Westmonasterio.”
His English imprint, with sundry variations,
was most frequently “Printed in Caxton’s house at Westmynstere.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blades gives a list of ninety-eight separate works
identified as Caxton’s, in addition to which there are eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
or ten others concerning which the evidence is doubtful.
The titles of the first five, printed in Bruges, in co-operation
with Mansion, have already been cited. I give the
titles of the remaining ninety-three:</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1477. “Dictes and Sayings of Philosophers,” translated by Earl Rivers.
This was probably the first book printed in England. The first printed book
in Italy was issued in 1464, and was a “Donatus.” The first book printed in
France bears date 1469, and was an edition of the “Letters of Kaspar von
Bergamo.” A large proportion of the publications identified as Caxton’s
were printed without imprint or specification of the place or date of issue.
Mr. Blades is able, however, to give a list of twenty books which bear the
record of having been printed at Westminster. The imprints and colophons
show a pleasing variety in form and in spelling.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1478. Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales.” 1st edition. Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The “Canterbury Tales” had been written about 1395, and during the
century which preceded this first printed edition, the work had secured an
assured prestige and a circulation which for a book in manuscript must have
been very considerable. As one of the most famous productions of English
literature, it was a very natural selection to be included with Caxton’s
earlier publications. This first edition was in fact the tenth work produced
from the Caxton Press. The second edition was printed about six years
later (Blades says “probably 1484”), and appears to have had the advantage
of a more correct or more complete text. In a prefatory note printed by the
publisher in this volume, Caxton gives the following account of the way in
which this better text came into his hands: “Of which book so incorrect
was one brought to me six year passed, which I supposed had been very
true and correct, and according to the same I did imprint a certain number
of them, which anon were sold to many and divers gentlemen: of whom one
gentleman came to me, and said that this book was not according in many
places unto the book that Geoffrey Chaucer had made. To whom I answered
that I had made it according to my copy, and by me was nothing added or
diminished. Then he said he knew a book which his father had and much
loved, that was very true, and according unto his own first book by him
made; and said more, if I would imprint it again, he would get me the same
book for a copy. How be it, he wist well his father would not gladly part
from it; to whom I said, in case that he could get me such a book true and
correct, that I would once endeavour me to imprint it again, for to satisfy
the author: whereas before by ignorance I erred in hurting and defaming
his book in divers places, in setting in some things that he never said nor
made, and leaving out many things that he made which are requisite to be
set in. And thus we fell at accord; and he full gently got me of his father
the said book, and delivered it to me, by which I have corrected my book.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1478. “The Moral Proverbs of Cristyne,” translated by Earl Rivers.
Folio.</li>
<li class="ifrst"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Christine de Pisa wrote these “Proverbs” about 1400. Thomassy speaks
of her as, with the exception of Joan of Arc, the most famous woman of her
age.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Blades says of her that she was early left a widow, with children and
parents to support, and urged on by necessity, she devoted herself to a literary
life, and soon became famous, and that for many years her labours
were incessant. He appears to be of the opinion that she succeeded in
securing a livelihood by her pen. If this opinion be correct, Christine was
certainly a marked exception to the other authors of the fourteenth century.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1478. “The Horse, the Sheep, and the Goose.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This is not a treatise on the care of domestic animals, but a series of dialogues
in verse, attributed to Dr. John Lydgate. It reached a second edition.</li>

This reached a second edition.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1479 (about). “The Book of Courtesy.” 4to.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1479. “Boethius de Consolacione Philosophiæ,” translated into English
by Geoffrey Chaucer. Folio. “I William Caxton have done my devoir to
emprinte it.”</li></ul>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>With the exception of the anonymous French version printed by Mansion
in Bruges, in 1471, this was the first edition of this perennial work issued in
Europe in any version but the original Latin. The earliest printed edition
of the Latin, that of Koberger, had been issued in Nuremberg in 1473.
Boëthius had received continued attention at the hands of the scribes, and
the number of manuscript copies available for the earlier printers was possibly
greater than of any other classic. M. Paris speaks of five different translations
of the “De Consolacione” into French verse, which had been
produced in the fifteenth century. Mr. Blades says that the version by
Chaucer was made not from the French, but from the original Latin. One
of the three copies of the Caxton edition in the British Museum, which was

1245, by the Duke of Berri. The Latin original, “Speculum vel Imago
Mundi,” was the work of some unknown author writing early in the thirteenth
century. The number of manuscript copies which had been preserved,
is evidence of its early popularity. Caxton’s judgment in reviving
the work in an English version and a printed edition proved to be well
founded, as it passed through various editions. This first edition was, however,
not the speculation of the printer, the cost of its production having

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This poet, several of whose productions have been preserved by Caxton’s
Press, died in 1461, about fifteen years before Caxton began his printing
work. While not quite a contemporary, he was one of the few English
authors of his own times with whom Caxton’s imprint is associated. The
poem presents a debate between Mercy, Truth, Justice, and Peace, together
with a metrical description of theology, geography, natural history, horticulture,
grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. I
am not sure from the description whether it is to be classed with light literature,
or may properly be considered as one of the publisher’s “solid” productions.</p>

Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This volume includes the most considerable and important original work
undertaken by Caxton. The “Polychronicon” had its origin with Roger
Monk, of St. Werberg in Chester, early in the fourteenth century. It was
continued by Higden of the same monastery, and, in 1387, Trevisa, chaplain
of the Earl of Berkeley, prepared from the Latin text an English version.
Caxton revised this version of Trevisa, and added a continuation of
the history, bringing the record down to 1460.</li>

therefore, to a previous century, but even as late as the century
succeeding his death, he continued to be the most widely read (at least in
England) of the English poets. It is probable that the literary authorities
of Caxton’s time rated Gower higher than Chaucer. It is certain that the
“Confessio Amantis” was one of the most successful of Caxton’s publications.
Some lines of Gower’s give an impression of the taste of English
readers in his time.</li></ul>

<li class="ifrst">His “Confessio Amantis” had, he states, been written at the command
of King Richard II., the same monarch to whom Froissart tells us he presented
a volume of the famous “Chronicles,” “fair illumined and written, and
covered with crimson velvet, with ten buttons of silver and gilt and roses of
gold in the midst, with two great clasps, gilt, richly wrought.” Richard’s
interest in books must, therefore, have included literature in two languages.</li>

1484. “The Golden Legend.” Folio. “Fynysshed at Westmere the
twenty day of Novembre/ the yere of our Lord M/CCC/LXXXIII/. By
me Wyllyam Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This work is described as the most laborious and most important of
Caxton’s literary and publishing undertakings. The collection from which
the various versions of “The Golden Legend” were derived was a compilation
entitled “Legenda Aurea,” made in the thirteenth century by Jacobus
de <span class ="err" title="original: Veragine">Voragine</span>, Archbishop of Genoa, in which were narrated the lives and
miracles of the Saints.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Caxton appears to have had before him, in preparing
his volume for the press, one of the many Latin texts, an English
version compiled about 1450, and the French version of Jean de Vignay.
In editing the collection for English readers, Caxton omitted a number of
the more incredible and more objectionable of the stories. Some of the
best of these stories are identical with those given in the “Gesta Romanorum,”
the first printed edition of which was issued by Koberger in 1493.
Caxton’s volume was extensively illustrated, and he speaks of the preparation
of the designs as having caused him much trouble and expense. The
undertaking was suggested by the Earl of Arundel, who agreed to take
“a reasonable number of copies,” and further to pay as an annuity “a
buck in summer and a doe in winter.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1484. “The Fables of Æsop”; of “Avian”; of “Alfonse”; and of
“Poge” (Poggio), the Florentine. Folio. “Emprynted by me William
Caxton at Westmynstre.” Illustrated. The text was translated by Caxton
from the French, and was the first version of “Æsop” in English.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1485. “Troylus and Creside.” Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1485. “The Lyf of Our Ladye.” Folio. “Emprynted by Wyllyam
Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This poem was the work of John Lydgate, and had been written at the
“excitation” of Henry V. It belonged to what may be called the popular
group of Caxton’s publications.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1485. “The Noble Histories of King Arthur and of certain of his
Knights.” Folio. “Emprynted in thabbey of Westmestre.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This was the work of Sir Thomas Malory, and was generally known as
the “Morte d’Arthur”; it was completed, as the author states, in 1470.
Caxton states in his Prologue, that Sir Thomas had “reduced” the romances
“from certain books in French.” I have not been able to find record of
the date of Malory’s death, but as Caxton makes no reference to any relations
with him, it is probable that in 1485 he was no longer living. His
“Histories” certainly, however, could be classed as contemporary literature,
and their selection by Caxton for the honour of a printed edition gives
the impression of a publisher who was not so absorbed in the literature of
the past as to be unmindful of the literary activities and possibilities in his
own community.</li>
<li class="ifrst"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Caxton gives in his Prologue his reasons for the selection of Malory’s
work for publication. He considers Arthur to be a national hero and one
of the nine great characters of the world’s history, his list comprising Hector,
Alexander, Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon. “In
these playsaunt historyes,” says Caxton, “may be seen noble chyvalrye,
curtosye, humanyte, frendlynesse, hardynesse, love, frendship, cowardyse,
murdre, hate, vertue and synne. Doo after the good and leve the evyl and
it shal brynge you to good fame and renommee.” A book containing all
this was certainly deserving of the honour of a printed edition. Caxton’s
selection of the “Morte d’Arthur” showed admirable publishing judgment.
The book was not only excellent “copy” for the time, but has had a more
abiding repute than perhaps any production of its age.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1485. “The Life of the Noble and Christian Prince Charles the Great.”
Folio. “Explicit per William Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This “Life” was based upon the biography (itself a compilation) by
Henry Bolomyer, Canon of Lausanne. The work, which is something
more than a translation, was undertaken by Caxton at the instance of Danberry,
treasurer of the King’s jewels, and of certain other persons of noble
estate and degree.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1485. “The Knight Paris and the Fair Vienne.” Folio. “Explicit per
Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">A translation by Caxton of a famous romance, which had originally been
written in “Catalane,” but of which versions had appeared in a number of
languages. It can be described as belonging to the popular literature of
Europe, for after securing a wide circulation in manuscript editions, it was
printed in Trevisa as early as 1482, in London, as above, in 1485, in Antwerp
in 1487, and frequently thereafter.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1487. “The book of Good Manners.” Folio. “Explicit et hic est
finis per Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This is the work of Jaques Legrand, an Augustinian friar, said to have
been a native of Toledo. It was written about 1370. Legrand was also
the author of the “Sophologium.” Caxton states in his Prologue that he
undertook the translation in response to a “death-bed request” of his
friend William Pratt, who was a man of influence in the Mercers’ Guild,
and Caxton refers to him as “a singular friend of old Knowledge.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1487. “Speculum Vitæ Christi.” Folio. “Emprynted by Wyllyam Caxton.”
Probably a translation of the French version of the “Vita Christi,”
written in 1410, by S. Bonaventura.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1488. “The Royal Book, or Book for a King.” Folio. “Translated out
of Frensshe into Englysshe by me Wylyam Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This is a translation of “Le Livre des Vices et des Vertus,” said to have
been written early in the fourteenth century by Friar Laurent, confessor of
Philip the Bold. The book had come into general circulation in France
and had been twice translated into English before the version of Caxton.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1489. “The Faytes of Arms and of Chivalry.” Folio. Per Caxton.</li>
<li class="ifrst"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
This is a translation by Caxton of the work of Christine de Pisa of
Venice. It was written in France about 1400. In her preface, Christine
says: “Because men of arms are not clerks, nor instructed in the science
of language, I have assembled and gathered together diverse books to produce
this work, and because that this is a thing not accustomed and out of
usage to women, which commonly do not intermit but to spin on the distaff
and to occupy themselves in the things of the household; I supplicate
humbly ... to have nor to take for no evil if I, a woman, charge
myself to treat of so high a matter.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1489. “Statutes of Henry VII.” Folio. The earliest known volume of
statutes, and noteworthy also because printed in English.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1489. “The Governal of Health”; “The Medicina Stomachi.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">The “Governal” was originally written in Latin, but was translated into
English before Caxton’s time. It is a compilation from the writings of certain
Greek and Arabian physicians. The “Medicina” is attributed to
Lydgate, who seems to have been Caxton’s favourite author.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1489. “The Four Sons of Aymon.” Folio.</li>

<li class="ifrst">A translation by Caxton of a very famous and popular romance, which
originated probably as early as the twelfth century. Caxton’s version was
apparently produced from the volume printed in Lyons in 1480, “Les
Quatre Filz Aymon.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1490. “Eneydos.” Folio. “Translated by me Wyllyam Caxton.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">The original was not a version of the “Æneid,” but a romance based in
part on the “Æneid,” and in part on the “Fall of Princes” of Boccaccio.
Mr. Blades points out that a good sale was probably expected for it, as a large
impression was struck off, and the existing copies are therefore comparatively
numerous. The book failed, however, to reach a second edition.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1490. “A Book of Divers Ghostly Matters.” “Emprynted at Westmynstre.
Qui legit emendet, pressorem non reprehendat Wyllelmn Caxton.
Cui, de alta tradat.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">The volume contains, with various writings, the “Rule of S. Benet.”
The compilation is credited to Jehan de Sonshavie.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1491. “The Arte and Craft to Know Well to Die.” Folio. Translated
by Caxton in 1490.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The complete work, of which Caxton’s volume is an abridgment, had
been known during the century, in manuscript form, under the title “The
Art and Craft to Live Well and to Die Well.” It had been printed in Latin
in Paris in 1483. Caxton had probably utilised for his translation the
French version printed in Bruges by Mansion.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1491. “The Chastening of God’s Children.” Folio. Authorship unknown.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1491. “Ars Moriendi”: That is to say, “The Craft for to die for the
Health of Man’s Soul.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">A translation, by Caxton, of a Latin tract. The only copy known, either
in MS. or in print, is in the Bodleian Library. This is the latest work certainly
identified as Caxton’s, and, as he died in 1491, it is very possibly the
last undertaking of his busy life.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>I have classed under the dates specified, the works
selected as representative of Caxton’s undertakings. I
should explain, however, that the greater number of them
were issued without date, and many without imprint of
any kind. Mr. Blades has, with painstaking skill, identified
the volumes issued from Caxton’s Press during the
lifetime of the master, by a careful analysis and classification
of the type used. He finds that six different fonts
were utilised in all, the first being that secured from the
wreck of Mansion’s concern in Bruges and forming the
beginning of Caxton’s plant at Westminster, and the others
having been added from year to year, according to the
requirements and according also to the resources available.
Very few of the books had any title-pages, and when the
name of the author is mentioned, it must, as a rule, be
looked for in the publisher’s or translator’s prologue. In
some instances the dates of the printing have been arrived
at or approximated by the references made by Caxton in
his Prologue, or in a concluding paragraph, to the date
when the work of the translation had been completed.
In the small number of volumes containing an imprint,
the pleasing variety of the form and spelling of such
imprint is to be noted. The more usual wording is
“Emprynted by me Wyllyam Caxton at Westmynstre,”
but from this form there are a number of modifications.
In selecting from the list of Caxton’s publications certain
titles taken as fairly representative of the general character
of his undertakings, I have avoided specifying any re-issues
or later editions. As the entire typesetting had to
be repeated, the labour and expense of producing a
second edition was for the manufacturing items very
nearly as great as for the original publication. The illustrations
were, however, in the majority of cases, available
for the reissue, while the work of translating or of the
compilation, collation, and revision of texts needed, of
course, to be incurred but once. There was, therefore, a
better prospect of satisfactory returns if a second edition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
could be reached, while the record of such editions serves
also as a partial test of the publisher’s judgment in
gauging the taste and the interest of his public. Of the
ninety-eight works issued by Caxton, three reached,
during his lifetime, a third edition, the <i>Dictes of Philosophers</i>,
the <i>Parvus Chato</i>, and the <i>Horæ</i>. While of fifteen,
including, of course, the above, second editions were
called for, the other twelve titles being: <i>The Horse, the
Sheep, and the Goose</i>, <i>The Chorle and the Bird</i>, <i>The Game
of Chesse</i>, <i>Indulgence</i>, <i>The Chronicles of England</i>, <i>The Canterbury
Tales</i>, <i>The Golden Legend</i>, the <i>Speculum Christi</i>,
<i>The Mirrour of the World</i>, <i>The Book of Courtesy</i>, and the
<i>Liber Festivalis</i>. A number of Caxton’s books were
issued, after his death, by De Worde in later editions.
The more noteworthy of these were <i>The Canterbury Pilgrimage</i>,
<i>The Chronicles of England</i>, and <i>The Golden Legend</i>.</p>

<p>Caxton’s absorption in his printing business at Westminster
and in his literary occupations did not prevent
him from continuing his association with the Mercers’
Company, in which he must have retained a number of
old friends. Blades finds record of a payment made, in
1479, to Caxton from the royal treasury, of thirty pounds
(equal to about four hundred and fifty pounds at this
time), “for certain causes or matters performed by him
for the said Lord the King”; and thinks it probable that
this payment was for assistance rendered to Edward IV.
and his retinue when fugitives at Bruges. It seems certain
that the friendship of Margaret of Burgundy, Edward’s
sister, secured for Caxton royal favour and interest in his
venturesome undertakings. <i>Tully</i> and <i>Godfrey</i> were
printed under the “protection” of the King, which
probably means that the cost of their production was
supplied from the royal treasury. Margaret, Countess of
Richmond, mother of Henry VII., and Earl Rivers,
brother to the King, were included in the list of Caxton’s
Court friends. <i>The Chesse Booke</i> was dedicated to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Earl of Warwick, which probably also meant some
measure of co-operation. <i>The Order of Chivalry</i> was
dedicated to Richard III. <i>The Faytes of Arms</i> was
translated and printed by Caxton, at the request of
Henry VII., while the <i>Eneydos</i> was specially presented
to Arthur, Prince of Wales. Caxton appears to have
been more fortunate than some of the courtiers of his
time, in being able, after the battle of Bosworth Field, to
retain with Henry the favourable relations he had had
with Richard. Caxton speaks of William Daubeney, the
treasurer of Henry VI., as his “good and syngular friend.”
William, Earl of Arundel, showed his interest in the work
of the Caxton Press by allowing to the printer a “yearly
fee of a buck in summer and a doe in winter.” Other of
Caxton’s friends, whose names are given by Blades, were
Sir John Falstoffe, described as a great lover of books, and
Hugh Bryce and William Pratt, important members in
the Mercers’ Company. Some of Caxton’s clients utilised
his services with commissions for translating as well as for
printing. For one “noble lady with many fair daughters,”
he produced <i>The Knyght of the Toure</i>. <i>The Book of Good
Manners</i> was printed by Caxton at the special request
(made on his death-bed) of Caxton’s old friend, William
Pratt, the purpose of the publication being “the amendment
of manners and the increase of virtuous living.”</p>

<p>It is a suggestion of Blades that the occasion for the
publication of the treatise <i>The Arte and Craft to Die
Well</i>, was the death, in 1490, of Caxton’s wife Maude.
Blades goes on to say, however, that there is no direct
evidence that the Maude Caxton who died in that year
and who was buried at S. Margaret’s was the wife of the
printer.</p>

<p>The work done by Caxton as a translator includes versions
of the following books: <i>The Whole Life of Jason</i>,
<i>The Mirrour of the World</i>, <i>Reynard the Fox</i>, <i>Godfrey of
Bulloyne</i>, <i>The Golden Legend</i>, <i>The Book Called Caton</i>, <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Knight of the Tower</i>, <i>Æsop’s Fables</i>, <i>The Order of
Chivalry</i>, <i>The Royal Book</i>, <i>The Life of Charles the Great</i>,
<i>The History of the Knight and the Fair Vienne</i>, <i>The Book
of Good Manners</i>, <i>The Doctrinal of Sapience</i>, <i>The Faytes
of Arms</i>, <i>The Arte and Craft to Die Well</i>, <i>Eneydos</i>, <i>The
Curial</i>, <i>The Life of S. Winifred</i>, <i>Blanchardin and Eglantine</i>,
<i>The Four Sons of Aymon</i>, <i>The Gouvernayle of Health</i>,
and the <i>Vitæ Patrum</i>. This last was, at the time of his
death not quite finished. These volumes, when printed,
comprised together more than forty-five hundred pages.
It would appear, therefore, that, apart from the very considerable
labours and responsibilities of the management
of his printing-office, nearly all the employees in which
must have required training in each detail of their work,
Caxton must have kept his time very fully occupied.
Blades finds record from Caxton’s journal, that ten weeks’
time was required for the translation of <i>The Mirrour of
the World</i>, containing one hundred and ninety-eight pages,
and twelve weeks for <i>Godfrey of Bulloyne</i>, which contained
two hundred and eighty-four pages. It may be assumed,
however, that leisure for the literary work could be found
only occasionally when the labour in the printing-office
did not happen to be continuous. The time required for
printing these books varied materially, according to the
book. The edition of <i>Cordyale</i>, a volume of one hundred
and fifty-two pages, was completed in seven weeks, while
the <i>Godfrey</i> took nearly six months. I do not find any
record of the number of copies printed in the editions,
nor does there seem to have been any uniform list of selling
prices.</p>

<p>Under Caxton’s will, it appears (the will itself not having
as yet been discovered) that fifteen copies of <i>The Golden
Legend</i> were “bequothen to the Chirch behove by William
Caxston.” The citation is from the parish accounts of S.
Margaret’s. In 1496, or about five years after the death
of Caxton, the churchwardens had sold but three of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
fifteen copies, for two of which they secured 6s. 8d. each
and for the third 6s. 4d. The remaining copies were sold
within the next sixteen years at an average price of 5s.
8d. It is probable that the price asked for these copies
by the churchwardens was, at the outset at least, based
upon the usual selling price of the printing-office.</p>

<p>Caxton died in 1491, when he was nearly seventy years
of age. He was at work until within a few hours of his
death upon the translation of the <i>Vitæ Patrum</i>. His
assistant and successor, Wynken de Worde, in the
colophon to the edition of this volume, makes the following
record of his master, the translator: “Thus endyth
the moost vertuous hystorye of the dewoute and right
renowned lyves of holy faders lyvynge in deserte, worthy
of remembraunce to all wel dysposed persones which hathe
be translated oute of Frenche into Englisshe by William
Caxton of Westmynstre late ded, and fynysshed at the
laste daye of hys lyff.”</p>

<p>The list of Caxton’s publications, as compared with the
lists of the first printers in Germany, Italy, and France,
is noteworthy in a number of respects. Caxton did not
undertake a single edition of the Scriptures or of any portion
of the Scriptures, while the books of the Bible had
formed the first and most important ventures of all the
early printers of the continent. Caxton’s judgment that
the England of his day was not asking for Bibles, was
confirmed by his immediate successors, and no edition of
the Bible was printed in England before the close of the
fifteenth century. The list contains also no theological
works, no editions of the Fathers, and, with the exception
of a single treatise of <i>Cicero</i> and a volume of <i>Boëthius</i>,
no works belonging to the older classics. Its most distinctive
feature is the long series of romances and legends
translated from the French, the translations of which were
largely the work of the printer himself. Noteworthy also,
of course, is the appreciation of the abiding literary importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
of Chaucer, the recognition of the availability
for popular sale of Gower, and the discovery and prompt
utilisation of Malory. Caxton was not only his own
translator, but he was his own adviser, that is, he seems
to have been dependent for his selections chiefly upon his
own knowledge of the literature of France and of Flanders.
While the earlier issues from the presses of Mayence,
Basel, Paris, and Venice, restricted almost exclusively
to the Scriptures, to editions of the Fathers, and of classics,
were in Latin, Caxton’s books were, with hardly an exception,
printed in English. It was evidently his purpose
to reach not the circles of scholars and theologians
(circles which undoubtedly were at the time small in
England), but as large a proportion as possible of the
English public. I can but think, in looking at the long
series of romances and poems and treatises on love, and
the like, that Caxton had in mind the taste and requirements
of women readers as well as of the men. In fact,
in the fifteenth as in the nineteenth century, there must
have been a larger share of leisure for the “fair ladyes”
than for the noble gentlemen, and it is to be borne in
mind that the first incentive towards his literary and publishing
undertakings came to Caxton from a woman, his
noble friend the Duchess Margaret of Burgundy. Caxton’s
books give us the impression that they were the
selections and productions of a man with a clear understanding,
a wide knowledge of the world, a keen sense of
humour, and a sympathy for pleasure-loving people, who
proposed to do what was in his power to imbue his fellow-countrymen
with an interest in literature. He printed certain
stories which, from a modern point of view, are open
to criticism, but it is evident from the pains taken by him
in his selections and eliminations, that he had a standard
of his own, and that in rejecting material which seemed
to him unworthy, he had in view the directing and developing
of the standard of his English readers. He seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
to have made comparatively few serious blunders, and
must be credited with good publishing judgment. He
had also the business wisdom not to attempt to go ahead
too fast. Copeland, one of his workmen, who was later
in business for himself, says in the Prologue to his edition
of <i>Kynge Apolyn of Thyre</i>, his first publication: “I am
gladly followynge the trace of my mayster Caxton, begynnynge
with small storyes and pamfletes, and so to
other,” a very sound policy for any publishing concern.</p>

<p>In the preface to his translation of <i>Blanchardin and
Eglantine</i>, Caxton makes an “apologie” for the literature
of romance and chivalry, which is worth quoting. The
translation had been made from the French, at the command
of the Duchess of Somerset, mother of King Henry
VII. The passage shows us that the old printers were
dealers in foreign books as well as in their own productions:
“Which book I had long to fore sold to my said
lady, and knew well that the story of it was honest and
joyful to all virtuous young noble gentlemen and women,
for to read therein, as for their pastime. For under correction,
in my judgment, histories of noble feats and valiant
acts of arms and war, which have been achieved in
old time of many noble princes, lords, and knights, are as
well for to see and know their valiantness for to stand in
the special grace and love of their ladies, and in like wise
for gentle young ladies, and demoiselles for to learn to be
stedfast and constant in their part to them that they once
have promised and agreed to, such as they have put their
lives oft in jeopardy for to please them to stand in grace,
as it is to occupy the ken and study overmuch in books
of contemplation.” This is possibly the earliest defence
of novel-reading which occurs in the records of English
literature.</p>

<p>The historian Gibbon makes it a cause of special regret
that, in the choice of his authors, Caxton “was reduced to
comply with the vicious taste of his readers; to gratify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
his nobles with treatises on heraldry, hawking, and the
game of chess, and to amuse the popular credulity with
romances of fabulous knights and legends of fabulous
saints. The father of [English] printing expresses a laudable
desire to elucidate the history of his country; but
instead of publishing the Latin Chronicle of Radulphus
Higden, he could only venture on the English version by
John de Trevisa.... The world is not indebted to
England for a single <i>first</i> edition of a classic author.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Blades, taking up the cudgels for his hero, points out
that Caxton very properly made a careful study of the
wants of the public which was about him. It was essential
for his purposes that the business should be placed on
an assured foundation and should be made profitable.
Caxton tells us in the preface to his <i>Charles the Great</i>,
that he earned his living by his printing-office. It seems
probable that he could have brought with him from
Bruges no further property than was required to get
his printing business into working shape, and it appears
that at his death he left for his heirs very little beyond
his presses, his type, and the remainders of the editions
of his books.</p>

<p>It is probable that the knowledge of Latin, even among
the circles that were interested in literature, must have
been at this time much less general in England than on
the Continent, and it is certain that the interest in theological
writings continued during the century following to
be very much smaller with Englishmen than with the
Germans reached by the presses of Wittenberg, Leipzig,
and Basel. It is, I judge, generally accepted that during
the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century,
the standard of general cultivation was lower, and the
extent of learning and of literary interests more limited
in England than in Italy or the Low Countries.</p>

<p>“The demand in England in the fifteenth century,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>says Blades, “was not for Bibles in the vernacular, nor for
Horace nor Homer, whose writings very few could read in
the original texts; but the clergy wanted service books,
and Caxton accordingly provided them with Psalters,
Commemorations, and Directories; the preachers wanted
sermons, and were supplied with <i>The Golden Legend</i>; the
‘prynces, lordes, barons, knyghtes, and gentilmen,’ were
craving for ‘joyous and pleysaunt historyes’ of chivalry,
and the Press at the Red Pale produced a fresh romance
nearly every year. Poetry and history required for their
appreciation a more advanced standard of education
[than at this time obtained in England], and of these,
therefore, the issue was comparatively scanty.”</p>

<p>The England of Caxton’s time was torn asunder by
civil war. The year 1471, in which Caxton was beginning
his printing undertakings in Bruges, was the year in
which was fought, only a few miles from London, the
battle of Barnet, and it was the year of the death of Warwick
and of Henry VI. The year 1485, in which Caxton
was busied with the translation and printing of several
of his most important books, including <i>Charles the Great</i>,
witnessed the battle of Bosworth Field and a change of
monarchs in England. All the troubles of the civil wars
and the excitement connected with the overthrow of a
great political party and the accession of a new king had,
it seems, little influence upon the preference of that small
portion of English society which was interested at all
in literature, for “joyous and pleasant histories.” It was
doubtless also the case that this direction of literary taste
was influenced by the preferences and the knowledge of
Caxton himself and of his associate and successor, Wynken
de Worde. They brought with them to England the literary
interests and standards of the gay Flemish capital,
in which the capacity for pleasure and enjoyment was developed
to its fullest extent. The rule of the Puritans in
England was still more than a century distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span></p>

<p>It is probable that a remunerative demand could have
been secured for an edition of the Bible or of the New
Testament printed in the vernacular. There were, however,
difficulties in the way. Sir Thomas More has
clearly shown the reason why Caxton could not venture
to print a Bible, although the people would have greedily
bought Wyclif’s translation. There were translations of
the Bible before Wyclif, and that translation which goes
by the name of this great reformer was probably made up
in some degree from those previous translations. Wyclif’s
translation was interdicted, and thus More says: “On
account of the penalties ordered by Archbishop Arundel’s
constitution, though the old translations that were before
Wyclif’s days remained lawful and were in some folks’
hands had and read, yet he thought no printer would
lightly be so hot to put any Bible in print at his own
charge, and then hang upon a doubtful trial whether the
first copy of his translation was made before Wyclif’s
days or since. For if it were made since, it must be approved
before the printing.” This was a dilemma that
Caxton would have been too prudent to encounter.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Caxton’s experience as a publisher did nothing toward
the development of any conception of literary property.
Such literary labour as was contributed to his publications
was his own work, and if there had at that time existed
in England anything of the nature of copyright, the ownership
in such copyright would, for the series of translations
which comprised the most important portion of
Caxton’s list, have been vested in the publisher himself.
There seems to be, in the record of his business in Westminster,
no reference to any literary payments whatever,
that is to say, to any arrangements for editorial service or
to compensation to scholars for the collection or collation
of manuscripts. In this matter of the securing of “copy”
for his Press, Caxton’s task was assuredly less arduous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>than that which came upon the first printers in Germany
or Italy. He had at his command or within his reach
the manuscript treasures of the great collections in Bruges,
and during the years which were spared to him for carrying
on the work of his Press, he was able to make but a
very small beginning in the work of placing before the
English public the legends and histories selected from
those collections.</p>

<p>Caxton brought into his publishing business methods
and standards which were the results of a long and honourable
experience as a merchant. While he did not
amass wealth, he seems to have sufficiently mastered the
principles of a balance-sheet to have been able to carry
on his undertakings with a full measure of independence
and with no such serious financial anxieties as those which
oppressed Gutenberg or which hampered the too idealistic
ventures of Aldus. Caxton was evidently a clear-headed,
practical man of business (although his interests
came to be rather literary than commercial), possessing a
keen sense of humour, shown in his appreciation of the
best humorous literature of the time, and with a perception
far beyond that of his publishing contemporaries as
to the actual requirements of the public he was endeavouring
to serve. Caxton made no claim to scholarship in
the sense in which the term was used in the fifteenth
century, but he is justly to be ranked with the men of
letters. He was evidently a good linguist, having a thorough
knowledge of French and Flemish, and a sufficient
familiarity with Latin to enable him to print correctly
books in that tongue, and to translate from Latin into
English. In his edition of <i>The Golden Legend</i>, in the
<i>Life of S. Roche</i> he prints the following record: “Which
lyff is translated oute of latyn in to englysshe by me,
Wyllyam Caxton.” His English style was fluent, and will
compare favourably with that of other writers of the time.
In the prologues and epilogues attached to his translations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
he utilised freely (as was the custom of the time)
material from various sources, altering this as he found
convenient, and it is not always easy to distinguish between
the pages that were original with himself and those of
which he was simply the translator. He was able, however,
to stamp his own individuality pretty thoroughly on
all the editorial portions of his volumes, and occasionally,
as in the sharp satire of women in the <i>Dictes and Sayings
of Philosophers</i>, we find something which seems to be very
definitely an expression of personal opinion.</p>

<p>For poetry Caxton had a cordial appreciation, and he
printed the most noteworthy poems which were within
his reach. In his second edition of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>,
he speaks of Chaucer as “the first founder of ornate eloquence
in our English.” In history, the only works at
that time available in English were the <i>Chronicle of Brute</i>
and the <i>Polychronicon</i>. To the latter, Caxton himself prepared
a continuation, bringing the narrative down nearly
to his own time. Some of the earlier English authors, in
recognition of the value of his work as a chronicler, class
Caxton among the historians, while overlooking his distinctive
service in introducing into England the art of
printing. He was evidently a man of wide reading, and
the acquaintance which he possessed with existing literature
must have seemed very exceptional for his generation.
His great delight was in romances, but he takes
pains to tell us that these pleased him not simply for their
accounts of feats of personal prowess, but rather for the
examples presented in them of “courtesy, humanity,
friendliness, hardiness, love, cowardice, murder, hate, virtue,
and sin, which inflamed the hearts of the readers
and hearers to eschew and flee works vicious and dishonest.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>”</p>

<p>In his long and varied business career Caxton appears
to have made no enemies and to have given no grounds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>for criticism or complaint, and during the troublous times
of civil war he was able, notwithstanding his intimate
relations with some of those high in authority, to preserve
his independence of character and an unsullied record.
He was not a man of genius, nor, perhaps, of the highest
ideals; but he showed imagination, enterprise, and persistent
courage. His work was honestly, intelligently, and
effectively done, and his country has good reason to honour
the memory of its first publisher.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">Wynken de Worde.</h3><p class="heading">—Caxton’s successor, Wynken de
Worde, was by birth a Lorrainer, and had accompanied
Caxton on his removal from Bruges to London. He had
made good use of his years of preliminary training, and
he was able largely to improve upon Caxton’s printing
methods, while in his publishing undertakings, he had the
advantage of a constantly widening circle of readers of
books. His publications comprised no less than four
hundred separate works, covering a wide range of literature.
He does not appear himself to have undertaken
any translating or editorial responsibilities, and in fact no
one of the English printers of the sixteenth century is to
be placed in the group of scholars to which belonged
Aldus, Froben, and the Estiennes.</p></div>

<p>The demand for printed books in England, a demand
which had, as we have seen, antedated the establishment
of Caxton’s Press at Westminster, was much greater than
could be satisfied by either Caxton, or his immediate successors,
De Worde and Richard Pynson, and the importation
of books from Paris, Rouen, Bruges, Antwerp, Cologne,
and other continental cities, increased steadily during the
last part of the fifteenth and the first portion of the sixteenth
century. Of a number of the English publications
of this period, the editions were printed on the Continent
especially for the English market. Humphreys cites,
among other instances, a series of missals printed in 1516
by Olivier of Rouen for the church of York, and an edition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of the <i>Chronicles of England</i> printed (in English) in Antwerp,
in 1493, by Gerard Leew.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> These Rouen missals
were among the last of the Roman Catholic books of service
printed abroad for the use of the English churches,
as, in 1534, these churches adopted the <i>Ritual of the
Reformation</i>. The title of the chronicles reads, “<i>Chronycles
of the Lond of Englond</i>.”</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">Printing in Oxford.</h3><p class="heading">—The second printing-office established
in England was that of Oxford. The authority on
the earlier history of printing in Oxford is the treatise
and comprehensive bibliography of Mr. Madan, published
in 1895, under the title of <i>The Early Oxford Press</i>. Some
of the earlier historians of the University had claimed for
the Oxford Press an earlier date than that of Caxton’s
undertaking. This claim has rested almost entirely on
the date 1468, which appears in the colophon of a treatise
on the Apostles’ Creed, which treatise, says Madan, was
undoubtedly the first product of the Oxford Press. The
authorship of the volume as printed is ascribed to
S. Jerome, and it is so referred to by Humphreys and
other writers. Madan points out, however, that the
actual author was Tyranneus Rufinus. It is his conclusion
that the date 1468 (which is nine years earlier than
the date of the first Caxton publication) is undoubtedly
an error, and an error probably due to a single misprint.</p></div>

<p>The history of this volume came to possess some importance
apart from its relation to the chronology of the
English printing-press. In 1664, Richard Atkyns, a
graduate of Balliol, printed in London a monograph entitled,
<i>The Original and Growth of Printing, Collected out
of History and the Records of this Kingdome. Wherein is
also Demonstrated that Printing Appertaineth to the Prerogative
Royal, and is a Flower of the Crown of England.</i>
It was the purpose of Atkyns to recommend himself to
the attention of King Charles II. by proving that printing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>was a royal privilege, and for this purpose it was desirable
that there should be evidence of the introduction of the
art into England under royal protection. The history of
the establishment of the printing-press of Caxton did
not give grounds for such a claim. In this Oxford volume
bearing date 1468, Atkyns found, however, the evidence
which could be made to serve his purpose. He goes on
to give in his narrative a story, more or less confused, as
to persons and places, the purport of which was, that at
the instance of Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury,
King Henry VI. had taken measures to bring into
the kingdom a “printing-mold.” The King, says Atkyns,
was a “good man and much given to works of this
nature.” He was very ready to further the undertaking,
and he provided a considerable sum of money, to be used
for enticing away some of the workmen from <i>Harlein in
Holland</i>, where the art had recently been invented by
<i>John Cuthenberg</i>. “The money was confided to me,
Robert Tournour, Master of the Robes, who took into his
assistance Mr. Caxton, a citizen of good abilities, who
traded much in Holland.” Further details of the journey
to Holland made by Tournour and Caxton are given, with
the final result that they succeeded in getting off one of
the under workmen, whose name was Frederick Corsells
(or Corsellis). It was not thought prudent to set Corsellis
to work in London, and he was, therefore, taken to Oxford,
where, according to this theory, he instituted the
first printing-press in England. Atkyns goes on to point
out that “This press at Oxon was at least ten years before
there was any printing in Europe (except at <i>Harlein</i> and
<i>Mentz</i>) where also it was but new born.” Later, “the
King set up a press at St. Albans and another at the
Abbey of Westminster, where they printed several books
of Divinity and Physics (for the King, for reasons best
known to himself and Council, permitted no law books to
be printed), nor did any printer exercise that art but only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
such as were the King’s sworn servants; the King himself
having the Price and Emolument for Printing Books.”
For the mixing up in this narrative of Harlem and Koster
and Mentz and Gutenberg, it is to be noted, Atkyns refers,
as his authority, to an old manuscript in Lambeth, which
has, however, not been found.</p>

<p>This story of Atkyns is dismissed by Madan (as it had
previously been dismissed by Humphreys and Blades) as a
“clumsy forgery.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It is of interest, however, as indicating
the theory of the Crown, or at least the theory which
the Crown was supposed to favour at the time of Charles
II., concerning the relation of the printing-press to the
Crown and the historic foundation for the royal claim to
control and supervise printed literature.</p>

<p>If the corrected date of 1478 be accepted for the
<i>Rufinus</i>, it still appears that the work of printing in Oxford
began very promptly after the establishment of the
Caxton Press in Westminster. It is further evident from
the comparison of the typography and other manufacturing
details of this first Oxford volume and of its immediate
successors, that the methods and instruction of
the Oxford printers were not derived from London or
from Bruges, but are to be connected directly with the
undertakings of the printers of Cologne, and more particularly
with the orifice of Ulrich Zell, whose name has
already been referred to.</p>

<p>The second Oxford publication, bearing an unquestioned
date of 1479, is an edition of a treatise by Bishop Ægidius
de Columna, of Rome. The third work, issued in
the same year, was a Latin translation, prepared by
Brunus of Arezzo, of the <i>Ethics</i> of Aristotle. The fourth
publication, issued in 1480, was an edition of the oration
of Cicero, <i>Pro Milone</i>. Both Madan and Blades are of
opinion that the book probably belonged to Oxford and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>to this year, although the evidence is not conclusive.
If the book has been correctly placed, it is the first Latin
classic printed in England, the second being a <i>Terence</i>
issued (in London) in 1497.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The work of the first printing-press
of Oxford came to a close suddenly in 1487. The
printing at St. Albans ceased at about the same time.
The first printers in Oxford did not connect their names
with their volumes. The name of the printer of the
<i>Rufinus</i> and of the <i>Ægidius</i> has not been traced. The
printer of the <i>Cicero</i>, and of some works following the
<i>Cicero</i>, is identified as Theodoricus Rood de Colonia.
The same name appears in connection with that of Thomas
Hunt (Anglicus) as the printers together, in 1485, of the
<i>Letters of Phalaris</i>. Thomas Hunt’s name is recorded in
1473, as that of a <i>Universitatis Oxoni Stationarius</i>. A
record has been preserved, bearing date 1483, in which
Sir Thomas Hunt agrees to sell certain books in Oxford at
fixed prices. Madan suggests that the stopping of the Oxford
Press in 1487 may have been due to the departure
of Rood for Cologne, as he finds record of the printing
in Cologne in that year of certain books in a type similar
to that used for the preceding Oxford volumes, by a
printer registered as <i>Theodoricus</i>.</p>

<p>During the years 1517 and 1518, editions of Burley on
<i>Aristotle</i>, Burley’s <i>Principia</i>, and three or four other books
were printed in Oxford by Johannes Scolar and Carolus
Kyrfoth. These were evidently Germans, and were
probably from Cologne. Three of the works were issued
<i>cum privilegio</i>. After 1518, printing ceases in
Oxford for nearly forty years.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">Later English Presses.</h3><p class="heading">—The third place in England
in which a printing-press was established was the Abbey of
St. Albans, an abbey which during the manuscript period
had had a long and honourable association with literary
activity. The first book issued from the St. Albans Press,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>the <i>Exempla Sacræ Scripturæ</i>, bears date 1481. The
type is from the same font, or from a precisely similar
font, as that used in the Caxton volumes of this year, and
Humphreys is of opinion that Caxton was concerned in
this St. Albans undertaking. The most famous publication
of the St. Albans Press, which is also printed in
what may be described as a Caxton font of type, is <i>The
Bokys of Haukyng and Huntyng and also of Cootarmuris</i>,
by Dame Juliana Berners, who was Prioress of Sopwell
Nunnery near St. Albans. This work was printed in 1486,
and is frequently referred to as <i>The Book of St. Albans</i>.</p></div>

<p>The beginning of printing in the University of Cambridge
was delayed until about 1520. This was nearly
fifty years later than the establishment of the printing
concerns connected with the University of Paris, and
twenty-five years later than the beginning of the series of
editions of the classics issued from the Aldine Press of
Venice, which may properly also be described as the Press
of the University of Padua. The first publication of importance
bearing the imprint of Cambridge University
was an edition of Bulloc’s translation of <i>Lucian</i>, issued
in 1521.</p>

<p>The business of printing in London took a great development
when De Worde associated with him in the management
of the Caxton Press his assistant Richard Pynson,
who had been one of Caxton’s apprentices. These printers
made a large use in their volumes of engraved illustrations,
the blocks for which were in great part imported
from the Continent. Many of these engravings had evidently
been prepared originally for Flemish or German
books, and, having been purchased at second hand, were
frequently introduced into English books, without any
regard to their fitness in character, or to any relation to
the text. They were apparently, in fact, utilised not as
illustrations but simply as adornments. This practice of
importing illustrations from the Continent and of scattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
them miscellaneously through texts with which they
have no relation, is not unknown among English publishers
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>After the death of De Worde, Pynson continued the
work of the Caxton Press with his own imprint. Among
the more important of his earlier issues were the translation
of <i>Froissart</i>, by Lord Berners, and his English version
of the famous <i>Navis Stultifera Mortalium</i>, issued under
the title of <i>The Shyp of Folys</i>. Up to the date of about
1490, the fonts used in the Caxton Press were purchased
either in Bruges or in Cologne. In 1493, Pynson imported
some French fonts, which probably came from
Rouen. Lord Berners makes the “Book-fool,” the first
described of the passengers of the <i>Ship of Fools</i>, to speak
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am the firste fole of all the whole Navy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To kepe the pompe, the helme, and eke the sayle;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this is my mynde, this one pleasure have I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of books to have great plenty, and aparayle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet take no wisdom by them; nor yet avayle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor them perceyve not.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The fole” (whose modern name would, of course, be
“bibliomaniac”) possesses his books, in short, for show, for
the repute of having a library, and for their fine binding:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Full Goodly bounde in pleasant Couverture</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Damas, satin, or else of velvet pure.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pynson did not confine his list to books of satire or of
amusement, although these formed by far the larger proportion
of his publications. He continued the series of
chronicles begun by Caxton. In 1516, he published the
<i>Chronicle Fabyan</i>, in which Brute, of the regal family of
Priam of Troy, is made the founder of the first colony in
the British Isles. With hardly an exception, the books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of both De Worde and Pynson were very fully illustrated.
Their interest in illustrated texts had been formed in the
environment of the Flemish school, the printers in which
seem to have considered that a book without illustrations
was hardly complete. It was of course also the case that
the class of literature selected by the first group of the
English printers was in its subject-matter much more
available for illustration than were the classical texts or
the controversial and theological treatises which were at
this time absorbing so large a share of the attention of
the printers in Paris, in Germany, and in Switzerland.</p>

<p>The first Bible published in England was Tyndale’s
English version of the New Testament. This first issue,
however, was printed, not in England, but in Cologne, at
the Press of Quentell. Tyndale was by birth a Welshman.
After studying in Oxford and in Cambridge, he
sojourned in Antwerp, and in that city he completed,
in the year 1525, with the assistance of John Fryth and
Joseph Royes, his translation of the New Testament.
The supplies of the book when forwarded to London
were very promptly bought up; but as soon as the ecclesiastical
authorities had an opportunity of examining the
book, it was put under ban, and all copies that could be
found were seized and destroyed. At the instance of the
Roman Catholic party in England, Tyndale was, in 1536,
arrested at Antwerp, under the authority of the Emperor
Charles V., and after being imprisoned for eighteen
months, was burned. A similar fate befell his assistants,
Fryth having been burned at Smithfield, and Royes in
Lisbon. It is not clear from the record at what time the
translation by Tyndale of the Pentateuch was produced,
but it appears not to have been printed until after Tyndale’s
death. In 1535, a complete English Bible, comprising
Tyndale’s version of the New Testament and the
Pentateuch and a translation prepared by Coverdale and
others, of the remaining books of the Old Testament, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
printed on the Continent, the name of the printer not
being given. Humphreys is in accord with Wanley in
the belief that this Coverdale Bible was printed at Zurich
by Christopher Froschauer. Coverdale utilised, as the
basis of his portion of the translation, the German Bible
of Luther, but makes references also to the Latin Vulgate.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the freedom of the English Press and
for the spread of religious belief through the instruction of
the Scriptures, it happened that, shortly after the completion
of the Coverdale Bible, Henry VIII. wanted to marry
Anne Boleyn. I need not here refer to the large results
brought about in connection with this particular preference
of the King. It is sufficient to point out that, with the
close of the supremacy of the papal power in England,
and with the addition of Great Britain to the list of the
countries accepting the principles of the Reformation,
the printing and distribution of the English version of the
Scriptures became practicable. It would not be correct
to say that from this date the printing-press in England
was free, but it was the case that it became free for the
production of the Protestant Scriptures and of other
Protestant literature, while it was also the case that the
censorship put in force by the authorities of the English
Church never proved as severe, or as serious an obstruction
to publishing, as had been the case with the ecclesiastical
censorship of the Catholics.</p>

<p>The Coverdale Bible contains a series of graphic illustrations,
the designs for which some of the historians
have attributed to Holbein. The work was dedicated to
King Henry VIII., and the dedication makes reference
to his “just wyfe and vertouous prencesse Queene Anne.”
In the later editions, the name of Anne is replaced in
succession by those of the later queens.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The Bible known as “Matthews’s” was published in
London, in 1537, by Grafton. This appears to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>the first English Bible that was published under the
authority of the State. A royal license or privilege for
the publication was procured for it by Archbishop
Cranmer, who had interested in the undertaking Thomas
Cromwell, Earl of Essex. Humphreys speaks of Grafton,
the English publisher, as having furnished five hundred
pounds for the undertaking, the remaining portion of the
cost being provided by Cranmer and Cromwell. The
text was a combination of Tyndale’s and Coverdale’s.
The type is from a German font, and the work was probably
printed in Hesse.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The first English Bible printed in England was the
translation by John Hollybushe, which was issued in 1538
by John Nicholson, in Southwark. The great Cranmer
Bible was printed between 1539 and 1541, by Richard
Grafton and Edward Whitchurch. The funds for its
publication were supplied by Cranmer and Cromwell, and
the magnificent illustrations are ascribed to Holbein. This
work is described as the finest specimen of typography
and the best example of artistic and graphic illustrations
that had as yet been published in England. The
text contains a number of variations from that of Tyndale
and Coverdale. The first edition bore on the title-page
the arms of Cromwell, but in the second edition,
printed in 1540, these arms were omitted, the Earl having
perished on the scaffold in July, 1540. A separate
edition of this Cranmer Bible was printed in 1539 by
John Bydell, under the editorship of the Greek scholar
Taverner. This publication constituted an infringement
of the patent issued to Grafton, but no steps appear to
have been taken for his protection. Grafton continued
for some years to be the authorised publisher for the
Reformed Church of England, and he published in 1549
the first authorised Prayer-Book of the Church.</p>

<p>Next to Grafton, the most eminent of the English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>printer-publishers of the sixteenth century, was John
Day, who has been called the English Plantin. He
greatly improved the Greek and the italic types, and was
the first to make use of Saxon characters. His most
important publication was <i>The Acts and Monuments of
the Church</i>, by John Fox, commonly called <i>Fox’s Book of
Martyrs</i>, issued in 1563. This work exercised probably
a larger influence than any English book of the century
in completing the conversion of England from Romanism
to Protestantism, an influence which continued through
the following centuries. John Fox was a Fellow of Magdalen
College, Oxford, and after the death of Queen
Mary (during whose reign he had been an exile in Switzerland)
he was made a prebendary in Salisbury. I do not
find any record of his publishing arrangement with Day.
The <i>Book of Martyrs</i> came into immediate and continued
demand and ought to have brought to its author large
returns. His interest in the undertaking was, however,
evidently in connection with the fight against Rome, and
it is quite probable that he made his literary labour a
contribution to the cause of the Reformation. The book,
which was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, was printed in
excellent style, and the effectiveness of the long series of
dramatic and tragic narratives was very much heightened
by the graphic and well-executed illustrations. Its publication
was evidently considered by the Protestant
friends of Day to be the chief glory of his career. Over
his tomb in the village of Bradley Parva, the following
epitaph is inscribed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here lyes the Daye that darkness could not blinde,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Popish fogges had overcast the sonne;</div>

<p>The plan and compass of the present work will not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>permit any detailed account of the work of the English
printers and publishers during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. These centuries were periods of very
great literary activity, and were rendered noteworthy by
the production of some of the greatest works in the literature
of the world. A list of authors which includes such
names as those of Shakespeare, Spenser, Jonson, and
Bacon, gives an indication of the importance as a lasting
property of the books of the Elizabethan writers. The
literary productiveness of England came, however, in
advance of any system of law for the protection of literary
producers, and it is probable that neither the writers
above specified, nor any of their contemporaries, secured
compensation from the sales of their books.</p>

<p>Miss Scott,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> in her scholarly monograph on Elizabethan
translations from the Italian, in referring to the large influence
exercised by the literature of Italy upon the work
of the writers of the Elizabethan age, says that she has
“collected more than one hundred and sixty translations
from the Italian, made by ninety translators. The translators
include nearly every well-known Elizabethan
author, except Shakespeare and Bacon.” Apart from the
translations, it is evident that a very liberal use was made
by English authors of the time, and especially by the
dramatists, of Italian stories and other literary material
which could be reshaped for the requirements of English
readers. Italy seems in fact to have served as a kind of
literary quarry for the authors of Elizabeth, very much
as Greece had done for the writers of the Augustan age.</p>

<p>The taste for romances appears to have continued without
abatement throughout the sixteenth century, the
stories put into print being very largely translations or
free adaptations of French and Italian tales. It was
a period when Italian thought and Italian literary methods
were beginning to exert a very large influence upon both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>writers and readers in England. Roger Ascham declaimed
against the pernicious tendencies of the Italian literature
in much the same language as has been used to-day
against the influence of French books upon the morals
of English readers. From Paynter’s <i>Palace of Pleasure</i>,
printed in 1561, which contained a series of studies from
French and Italian authors, were derived the plots of
several of Shakespeare’s plays, including that of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Certain of these volumes secured what can
be described as a popular success. <i>The Goodli History of
the Ladye Lucres of Scene in Tuskane and of her Lover
Eurialus</i>, a translation from the <i>Æneas Piccolomini</i>, went
through twenty-three editions in the fifteenth century and
was eight times translated.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> I do not find record of the
names of the fortunate publishers, but it is not probable
that the publisher who arranged for the translation first
issued, was able to keep his version from being appropriated
by others.</p>

<p>Mr. Furnivall cites a curious list of books which, in
1575, were recorded as the property of a man of the lower-middle
class, a mason by trade,—such a man, remarks
Jusserand, as would have been an average member of a
Shakespearian audience. The titles include <i>Kyng Arthurz
Book</i>, <i>Huon of Burdeaus</i>, <i>The Foour Suns of Aymion</i>,
<i>Bevis of Hampton</i>, <i>Lucres and Eurialus</i>, and a number of
other illustrated romances.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>English readers of the time were not only interesting
themselves in translations from the Italian, but were evidently
to some extent prepared to read their Italian
literature in the original. Among the books of which
editions printed in Italian were issued in London in the
latter part of the sixteenth century, was the <i>Pastor Fido</i>
of Guarini, published in 1590.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span></p>

<p>During the lifetime of Shakespeare, there were published
of his no less than seventy-two separate original
works, plays and poems, the first in date being <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>, in 1593, and the last, <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>, in 1616.
A number of these volumes reached a third or fourth
edition, and, notwithstanding the lack of adequate book-selling
machinery, the sales of many of them appear to
have been considerable. The authorities on the life of
Shakespeare are, however, I believe, in substantial accord
in the conclusion that the author secured from these sales
no direct benefit, and that the independent fortune accumulated
by him was derived from his pay as an actor,
from the interest later possessed by him in the business
of the theatre, and probably, also, from some recognition
on the part of the performing companies of the author’s
right to a share of the profits earned by his plays. Shakespeare
apparently benefited by stage-right if not by copyright.
The seventy-two publications above referred to
include only those which, having been duly entered for
copyright, may be described as “authorised.” There are
various references to unauthorised editions, but no record
of any one of these having been suppressed. The first
issue of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, printed by Richard Field, was
certainly authorised, as it contained a dedication by the
author. The copyright was registered in the name of
Field, while the book was published by John Harrison.
A diary of the time speaks of the selling price as being
twelve pence.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> <i>Lucrece</i>, published in its first edition in the
year following, was, like the earlier book, dedicated by the
author to the Earl of Southampton, and was likewise
printed by Field for Harrison. We find from this time
an increasing tendency to separate the business of printing
from that of publishing, while the copyright entry is
nearly always made in the name of the printer. <i>The Comedy
of Errors</i>, printed in 1594, was entered as belonging to
the Lord Chamberlain’s company, that to which Shakespeare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>was at the time attached. It was the case with
other, though not with all, of the plays, that the copyright
was vested in the company for which they had been written.
The first publisher who secured copyright in a play
of Shakespeare’s was Andrew White, who, in 1597, made
entry of <i>Richard the Second</i>. Neither in this case nor in
that of the long list of other printers and publishers who,
during the lifetime of the author, “claimed copie” in
Shakespeare’s writings, does it appear by what authority
they undertook to control such “copie.” While there
may possibly in the case of the plays have been assignments
or authorisations on the part of the theatre
company, there is, I understand, no record of, or specific
reference to, any such assignments. The first collection
of Shakespeare’s plays for which any measure of
completeness was claimed, was presented in the well-known
folio of 1623, the publication of which was supervised
by Heminge and Condell, who had been fellow
actors with the dramatist. It does not appear what compensation,
if any, the two editors secured for their labours
from printer or from publisher.</p>

<p>In order to find an instance of the payment of “copy
money” for an original work, we must look forward sixty
years later than the death of Shakespeare. The oft cited
agreement between Milton and the printer Samuel Simmons,
which was executed in April, 1667, is possibly the
earliest of the kind in the history of publishing in England.
Under this agreement, the copyright of <i>Paradise Lost</i> was
assigned for a present payment of five pounds, with the
obligation for a further payment of the same amount when
1300 copies had been sold. The agreement authorised
the printing of a second and a third edition (no limit being
fixed for the number of copies in either) on the payment,
at the time of each printing, of the further sum of
five pounds. The author received before his death ten
pounds in all, and his widow later relinquished for the
sum of eight pounds all further right in the “copy.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
first impression of the poem had not been sold at the
expiration of seven years, and trivial as the honorarium
to the author certainly was, it is probable, as Sir Walter
Scott remarks, that the publisher did not make much by
his bargain.</p>

<p>As an example of a more remunerative transaction,
may be cited, among others, the arrangement between
Dryden and the publisher Tonson for the poet’s translation
of <i>Virgil</i>, an undertaking from which Dryden received
nearly £1300. The date of the agreement was
1695, less than thirty years later than the date of the sale
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. We are now, however, approaching the
period of copyright law, while it was the case that during
the last years of the seventeenth century, the printer-publishers
of the Stationers’ Company appear to have
been sufficiently powerful, in advance of copyright statutes,
to secure for their “copies” a substantial measure
of protection, and thus to maintain the common-law
property rights assigned to them by their authors.</p>

<p>The earliest catalogue of books published in England
contains a list “of all books printed in England since the
dreadful fire, 1666, to the end of Trinity term, 1680.”
The statistical results of this catalogue of the productions
of the press for fourteen years have been ascertained.
The whole number of books printed was 3550; of which
947 belonged to divinity, 420 to law, 153 to physic; 397
were school-books. About one-half of these works were
single sermons and tracts. Deducting the reprints, pamphlets,
single sermons, and maps, it is estimated that,
upon an average, 100 new books were produced in each
year.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This average, which is based upon the estimate of
Knight, does not, however, give an accurate impression of
the actual production of each year,—the output of the
later years of the series being much more considerable
than of those immediately succeeding the fire.</p>

<p class="center">THE KOBERGERS OF NUREMBERG.</p>

<p class="center">1440-1540.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">ANTHONI KOBERGER (the elder), who for a
number of years held the position of the leading
publisher of his time, came of an old Nuremberg
family. One of his ancestors had been a burgomaster of
Nuremberg as far back as 1349, and took an active part
at that time in a successful effort to overthrow the rule of
the nobles over the city, and, during the two centuries
following, the Kobergers continued to be leading citizens.</p>

<p>Anthoni was born about 1440, or ten years before the
completion of Gutenberg’s printing-press. He was probably
brought up as a jeweller, an occupation in which in the
later years of his life he was again interested, but in 1472,
he devoted himself to the new art of printing, and in
1473 he issued the first volume, bearing a date, which is
certainly identified as his. The work chosen was one of
the great books of the world’s literature, <i>Boethii Liber de
Consolatione Philosophiæ cum Commentario Thomæ de
Aquino</i>, a dignified and judicious selection with which
to initiate the publishing undertakings of the Kobergers,
and one which was fairly representative of the general
character of their subsequent issues.</p>

<p>Albert Dürer, whose original trade was that of a goldsmith,
had served as godfather for Anthoni Koberger,
and Anthoni’s eldest son was apprenticed to Dürer. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
was a close connection, in Germany as well as in Italy,
between the earlier book illustrators and the goldsmiths
and other artificers in metals, and not a few of the first
designers and engravers, together with some of the best
of the printers, came, like Dürer, from the ranks of the
metal-workers.</p>

<p>The first printing-office in Nuremberg had been established
in 1470, by Heinrich Kefer, of Mayence (who had
been an assistant of Gutenberg), in company with Sensenschmid
from Eger, and their first publication was a tract
on the Song of Solomon, by Dr. Gerson, Chancellor of
Paris, who had died in 1429. It was very exceptional for
printers of this time to begin their operations with a work
by a contemporary or recent writer.</p>

<p>Anthoni’s active work as a publisher continued until
about 1513. His contemporary, Johann Neudorffer, writing
about 1509, says that he was then employing about
twenty-four presses, with over a hundred workmen, the
latter comprising compositors, pressmen, binders, correctors,
illuminators, and designers.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> All of these, says Neudorffer,
were provided with their meals by their employer,
in a building apart from the works, and they were obliged
to go between the two buildings at regular hours and
with military discipline. It is noteworthy to find so fully
organised and disciplined a book-manufacturing concern
within half a century after the beginning of printing, and
we may fairly assume that the founder was a man of distinctive
character and ability.</p>

<p>In the actual number of separate works issued, Koberger
was possibly equalled by one or more of his contemporaries,
but in respect to literary importance and
costliness, and in the beauty and excellence of the typography,
the Koberger publications were not equalled by
any books of the time excepting the issues of Aldus in
Venice. He did not limit his publishing undertakings to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>the works printed from his own presses, but gave contracts
for the printing of a number of important publications
to printers in other cities. In 1525, for instance,
Grüninger of Strasburg prints for Koberger the translation
by Pirckheimer of the <i>Geography</i> of Ptolemy, and
Amerbach of Basel, who had begun his work as a corrector
with Koberger, printed for him, later, a number of works.</p>

<p>Koberger’s correspondence shows that he had agents
or active representatives not only in the other book-centres
of the empire, such as Frankfort, Leipzig, Vienna,
Basel, Strasburg, and Cologne, but in more distant cities,
with which business interchange must, during the first
years of the sixteenth century, have been subject to
serious risks and to many interruptions, such as Paris,
Buda-Pesth, Warsaw, Venice, Florence, Rome, Antwerp,
Bruges, and Leyden. In this matter of organising connections
and distributing machinery throughout the Continent,
Koberger had a decided advantage over his great
contemporary Aldus, who found, as we have seen, no
little difficulty in maintaining permanent satisfactory
arrangements for the distribution of his books north of
the Alps. Aldus was obliged to depend chiefly upon his
direct correspondence with individual buyers among the
scholars of Europe, but Koberger secured larger results
by utilising the services of the book-trade, the organisation
of which in Germany and France was now taking
shape. He was himself, in fact, a bookseller as well as a
publisher and printer, selling both to the book-trade and at
retail, and he was the first of the booksellers of Germany,
and possibly of Europe, to issue a classified catalogue
of current publications. Kapp describes his book-shop
as the best equipped repository for standard literature
(<i>Sortiments-Buchhandlung</i>), in Germany. Possessing full
knowledge and experience of all divisions of book-making
and of book-selling, Koberger was in a position
to take an active part in furthering the organisation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the German book-trade, of which for a number of years
he was recognised as the natural leader.</p>

<p>One of the results of the Reformation had been, as will
be noted in the chapter on Luther, to transfer the centre
of literary activity from the south to the north of Germany.
Previous to this time, Nuremberg had been conveniently
enough located for the publishing trade and for
the distribution of books, but, if it had not been for the
energy and enterprise of Koberger, it would doubtless
have been very much outclassed in the importance of its
book-trade by some one of the cities possessing facilities
for water transportation. Koberger appears not to have
been a bigoted Romanist, but his sympathies were on the
whole with the Church party, and his theological publications,
which formed by far the most important portion
both of his undertakings and of his retail stock, were
nearly all in line with conservative Catholic theology.
The sales of all the older theological works, the writings
of the Fathers, etc., were very much lessened by the
effects of the Reformation, and, after the Reform doctrine
had begun to take root in Nuremberg, this division of the
business of the Kobergers was materially interfered with.
Notwithstanding the very considerable demand that came
up in Nuremberg for the writings of the Reformers, the
imprint of Anthoni Koberger appears never to have been
associated with any of these.</p>

<p>In order to indicate the general character of his undertakings,
I give the titles of some of the more characteristic
of his publications. I omit half a dozen volumes
issued prior to 1473, which have not certainly been
identified as Koberger’s.</p>

<p>The total list for the forty years from 1473 to 1513, in
which year Anthoni Koberger died, aggregates no less than
two hundred and thirty-six separate works. These were
nearly all in large octavo or quarto form, and the larger
number comprised several volumes. The most considerable
and the most costly undertaking was the Hugo
Bible issued in eight volumes. Anthoni issued in all no
less than fifteen issues or impressions of the Scriptures.
A very large proportion of his books were, as the selection
indicates, devoted to theology, and the list includes
a number of collections of sermons and tracts (always in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Latin text) by writers whose names are known otherwise
little or not at all. It is possible that the cost of the
printing of these was in some cases borne by the divines
who were responsible for them, but there is no reference
in the record of Koberger’s business to any publications
“for the author’s account.” It is not easy to understand
how it was practicable, within half a century of the beginning
of printing, to build up a publishing machinery
adequate for the effective distribution of such a collection
of solid literature. In fact, a publisher of to-day,
whether in Germany or elsewhere, would hardly venture
to base his business upon such a series of heavy books.</p>

<p>During the forty years of his work, Anthoni’s imprint
appears upon but three publications in German. The
number of classical editions is also much smaller than is
usual with the publishing lists of the period. In planning
his big series of Latin tomes, Koberger was addressing
himself to scholars, and only to scholars of the
orthodox Catholic faith. The production of editions of
the pagan writers he left to his great contemporary,
Aldus of Venice, and to Badius of Paris. The latter, in
the preface to his edition of the <i>Letters of Politian</i>, refers
to Koberger as “that glorious Nuremberger ...
esteemed by honourable men everywhere as the prince
of booksellers ... the man who conducted his business
with the most exact integrity, and with the highest
ideals ... with whom the production and distribution
of good books was carried on as a sacred trust.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Conrad Leontorius, a Cistercian monk, and the well-known
Jacob Wimpfeling, both speak of Koberger as “a
true Humanist,” which is evidence that, notwithstanding
his theological interests and associates, Koberger was by
no means to be classed with the narrow or bigoted
Romanists. A man who stood in intimate friendly relations
with such leaders of liberal thought as Conrad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Celtes, Albert Dürer, and Pirckheimer, must himself have
possessed some intellectual breadth and distinctiveness.
Koberger had a full mastery of Latin, which was, in fact,
a first requirement for any publisher of scholarly literature,
but with Greek his acquaintance appears to have
been limited. He did not venture upon any such serious
editorial responsibilities with his publications as those
undertaken by Aldus, and later by the Estiennes, but he
appears to have possessed excellent judgment in the
selection of scholarly editions and advisers. One of
Koberger’s associates emphasises “his enormous capacity
for persistent work, the far-seeing and wide-reaching enterprise,
the conscientious regard for the rights of others, the
large conceptions and the careful attention to details, the
keen sense of humour, and genial and cheerful manner,”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
qualities which must certainly have formed an exceptionally
advantageous combination for an effective business
career. His correspondents in Basel speak of him with
a cordial affection which indicated a closer relation
than that of mere business, and further evidence of such
friendship is afforded, after the death in Basel of his old
associate Amerbach, by the care given by Koberger to
Amerbach’s children. In 1500, the Emperor Maximilian
writes to “our trusty Anthoni Koberger, whose great
service entitles him to honour, alike from ourselves and
from the realm.”</p>

<p>Koberger seems to have had the all-valuable faculty of
making many friends and no enemies. He was valued
by the Catholics as a most serviceable ally and representative,
while by not a few of the Reformers he was
regarded as a personal friend, and in all the bitter controversies
of the time (the years immediately preceding
the Reformation) there appear never to have been any
harsh expressions used concerning the Nuremberg publisher.
It is true, however, that it was not until after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Koberger’s death that the religious contests developed
into their fiercer phase.</p>

<p>The most important work on the foregoing list of
Anthoni’s publications was, as said, the edition of Cardinal
Hugo’s Bible, in eight volumes folio. This work was
undertaken in co-operation with Koberger’s friend Amerbach
in Basel, and the volumes were printed in Basel.
The plan of the publication had, however, originated with
Koberger, and the larger portion of the very considerable
investment required for its production was supplied by
him. The Hugo, whose notes and commentaries formed
the basis for this edition, had been born at St. Cher in
Dauphiné, about the year 1200. He was for a time an
inmate of the Dominican cloister of S. Jacob, but, later,
became an instructor in the Theological Faculty of the
University of Paris. He prepared a revised text of the
Vulgate, known as the <i>Correctorium Bibliæ</i>, which was
never printed, but which was afterwards utilised in the preparation
of what was known as the Bible of the Sorbonne.
The work published by Koberger had been written about
1240, under the title <i>Postilla in Universa Biblia juxta
Quadruplicem Sensum</i>. It was used for two centuries
(of course in manuscript form) as one of the theological
text-books of the Sorbonne, but the codex from which
Amerbach’s type-setters did their work was secured from
the Cistercian monastery in Heilsbronn.</p>

<p>Hugo was made a cardinal by Pope Innocent IV., and
died in Italy in 1263. The text of the Scriptures as revised
by him, together with his notes, were utilised by
Luther and by a number of the later editors and translators
of the Scriptures, and the enterprise of Koberger in
preserving this text in printed form was, from a scholarly
point of view, fully justified. As a commercial venture,
the undertaking was, however, a mistake, the sales not
proving sufficient to return the very considerable outlay.
The Greek Testament of Erasmus, and the Lutheran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
versions of the New and of the Old Testaments, while
not the only editions of the Scriptures which proved remunerative
publications, were certainly very noteworthy
exceptions as to the extent of their popularity and of
their commercial value.</p>

<p>Koberger’s publishing catalogue had included, as said,
no less than fifteen impressions of the <i>Biblia Latina</i>, eight
of which presented material differences of notes and commentaries
which entitled them to be described as distinct
editions. In addition to these, he interested himself
in keeping in stock, and in describing in his <i>Sortiments-Catalog</i>,
examples of all the noteworthy issues of the
Bible as yet in print. These included the four-volume
Bible printed in Strasburg, 1478-1480, containing the
commentary of Walafrid Strabo (dating from 849) and
the notes of Anselm of Laon, written in 1117, the Lyons
editions of Castellanus and of Gradibus, and the several
issues of Froben and others in Basel. The characteristic
feature of all the editions of the Scriptures preceding the
Reformation was the long series of notes and commentaries.
Luther took the ground that the words of God
in Holy Writ had been so overlaid and overweighted with
the comments of men that their true purport was in danger
of being lost sight of or not properly apprehended.
In Luther’s Bible, therefore, the bold innovation was
adopted of printing the text of the Scriptures without
note or commentary.</p>

<p>In the year 1483, the year in which Luther was born,
Koberger published his German Bible. The text was
translated from the Latin of the Vulgate, and was illustrated
with woodcuts. I have not been able to ascertain
what was the German idiom used for this version, but it
was a form that never took any permanent place in the
literature of the country. Luther, referring to the Nuremberg
Bible, declared that “no one could speak German of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
this outlandish kind.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Two German versions of the
Bible had been published before this of Koberger, one in
Strasburg and one in Cologne. They were both based
on the Vulgate, and neither was complete. Some years
after the death of Anthoni Koberger, his nephew Johannes
issued the first Nuremberg editions of Luther’s version of
the New Testament and of the Psalms. Both volumes
were printed by Friedrich Peypus, and both were illustrated
by woodcuts. The fonts of type were the same as
those used in Anthoni’s Bible of 1483. The imperial
edict and the ecclesiastical censure do not appear to have
been effective in preventing the sale through South
Germany, in the usual channels, of these Nuremberg editions.
I have not been able to find record of any correspondence
between Johannes Koberger and Luther in
regard to these editions. In 1525, Luther made overtures
to Melchior Koberger concerning publishing arrangements
for the Lutheran books in South Germany, and suggested
using his book-shop in Wittenberg as a depot for the
Koberger publications. The negotiations came to nothing
however. The activity of the House appears by that
time to have been exhausted.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Anthoni Koberger had born to him no less than twenty-five
children, and it appeared, therefore, as if there should
have been no difficulty in perpetuating the family name
or in carrying on the work which had made the name
famous. The publishing concern was continued, however,
only until 1540, first by his nephew Johannes, and
later by his sons Anthoni and Melchior. With the death
of the founder, however, the energy and the initiative of
the House appear to have departed, and, during the succeeding
twenty-seven years, but fifty-three works were
added to the list of its publications. These additions included
a number of impressions of the <i>Biblia Latina</i>, editions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>of <i>S. Augustine</i>, <i>S. Ambrose</i>, and <i>Fulgentius</i>, and the
<i>Geography</i> of Ptolemy, edited by Pirckheimer. The last
work bearing the Koberger imprint was the <i>Bohemian
Bible</i>, issued by Melchior in 1540. This was printed for
him by Melchtaler, and, according to Hase, was not so
much a business undertaking as a contribution made by
Melchior to the cause of the Bohemian Brothers, a sect
in the teachings of which he had interested himself.</p>

<p>The fact that the first place in their undertakings was
given by the Kobergers to editions of the Bible is the more
exceptional, as, in the theological instruction of the time,
the Scriptures certainly occupied no such place, and, for
the thirty years following 1493, the Kobergers were the
representative theological publishers of Germany. As
their catalogue shows, however, they added to their long
series of Bibles the chief works, first, of the Fathers of
the Church, and, later, of the great scholastic writers.
The editions of <i>S. Ambrose</i>, <i>S. Augustine</i>, <i>S. Jerome</i>, and
<i>S. Chrysostom</i>, have already been referred to. Of these
works there were, however, other, if less desirable, editions
already in print. Among the authors first presented
in printed form through the enterprise of the Nuremberg
publishers were Petrus Lombardius (d. 1164), Hugo of St.
Victor (d. 1141), Alexander of Hales (d. 1245), Thomas
Aquinas (d. 1274), Bonaventura (d. 1274), and Duns
Scotus (d. 1308).</p>

<p>The authoritative works on Canonical Law were issued
from the Koberger Press, together with the series of Papal
Decretals of Gregory IX., Boniface VIII., and Clement V.
A much smaller measure of attention was given by him
to classic writers, but his list included an edition of <i>Selections
from the Teachings of Plato</i>, prepared by Alkinous,
and the <i>Introduction to Aristotle</i> of Porphyry. A work
which has retained a longer vitality than any of the
writings of the above formidable series of scholars is
the collection of monkish tales, probably compiled in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
thirteenth century, and known as the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,
the first printed edition of which was issued by Koberger
in 1494. In the year 1518 (that is, five years after the
death of Anthoni), there was published from the Koberger
Press the <i>Germania</i> of Franciscus Irenicus, which included
a special chapter on Nuremberg, contributed by Conrad
Celtes. Hase speaks of this as the first noteworthy attempt
to present German national history from a popular and
patriotic standpoint.</p>

<p>The catalogues of nearly all of the publishers whose
work was done within the half century succeeding Gutenberg
were devoted to what would to-day be described as
“heavy” literature. The most noteworthy exception to
this statement is the list of publications issued by Caxton
in London, between 1476 and 1492, a list which included
hardly any “solid” books. The long lists of folios of
scholastic writings give to the student of to-day the impression
that these first publishers felt a very serious responsibility
indeed in connection with the use of this
“God-given art” of printing, and would have considered
the use of the printing-press for frivolous literature as a
kind of breach of trust. This description would, however,
apply with exceptional force to the undertakings of the
first Koberger, whose name appears to have been associated
with no work more trifling than the famous <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>, which, while indeed to be described as fiction,
was fiction of a very pious character and purpose.
The catalogue of Koberger constituted, in fact, a very
good representation of the foundations of scholarly
Catholicism. The Catholic teachers, who rested their
contention for the supremacy of the Roman Church upon
history and tradition as interpreted for fifteen centuries
by the scholars of the Church, depended for the material
of their teachings upon such folios as those produced by
Koberger. Weighty as were these folios, and assured as
appeared to be the foundations upon which the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
structure of ecclesiasticism had been raised, their instruction
was undermined, and their authority, for a large
portion at least of the community, was overthrown a little
later by the influence of the widely circulated pamphlets
and sheets, the <i>Flugschriften</i>, which brought to the people
the teachings of the Reformers.</p>

<p>For the years between 1517 and 1532, the contest for
the control of German thought and of German faith was
fought out very largely by means of the productions of
the printing-press, and with these productions the fight
was between the folios and the pamphlets, the former
standing for the traditional faith of the Church Universal,
and the latter for the doctrines of the Reformers. In
North Germany the victory rested with the pamphlets.
Anthoni Koberger’s death occurred before the beginning
of this new epoch of thought and of this new phase of
publishing. His work had been completed during the
age of orthodox scholarship, the authority of which, previous
to 1513, had hardly been seriously questioned.</p>

<p>Jacob Wimpfeling, a Humanist, who was also an orthodox
Catholic, writing in 1501, says (in a phrase which is
curiously akin to the expressions from the Berlin or Leipzig
of to-day): “We Germans practically control the
intellectual world. We use our power and our influence
for the service of God, for the care of souls, and for the
development of the people.... It is for this work
that we owe the largest acknowledgment for the service
of a man like Koberger, who employs his publishing
facilities only for the production of that which is
best.”</p>

<p>At about the same date Amerbach writes to Koberger:
“You have never printed anything that is worldly or
frivolous; your books are all of righteous and godly
literature. For the support of the true faith and for the
development of godly scholarship, you have brought
before the world the books which are the most trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and authoritative, the books which have stood
the test of time.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It was to Koberger’s business advantage that the fiercer
strife of the Reformation was delayed until his own career
was at an end. As already indicated, the religious controversies
and the strife which they engendered interfered
seriously with the demand for existing literature. The
lists of the German publishers of the first decade of the
sixteenth century, were devoted almost exclusively to
editions of the Fathers and to works of doctrine or of
devotion prepared for Catholic readers, together with
editions of certain selected classics. The Lutheran
movement lessened to a very great extent the demand
for these three classes of books. With such burning
issues before them as were presented by the leaders on
either side of the great controversy, the people no longer
had leisure for pagan writers or for old-time theological
writings. While large numbers were absorbed in the
tracts coming from Wittenberg, the others whose sympathies
and belief remained with the Church of Rome were
more interested in the pamphlets of writers like Eck or
Cochläus, than in the <i>Confessions</i> of S. Augustine or the
treatises of S. Jerome. The publishers heretofore devoted
to theology, who were unwilling to place their imprints
upon the works of the Lutherans, and who were
also out of sympathy with the bitter and often by no
means scholarly pamphlets of their opponents, found their
business seriously undermined by the great contest which
was dividing Germany. While the Reformation did very
much to increase the demand for printed material and to
further the business of a number of publishers and booksellers
throughout Germany, it had a disastrous effect
upon the business of the Kobergers, and was an important
factor in bringing that business to a close.</p>

<p>A further important cause of the weakening of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>foundations of the concern was the impairment of the
capital, caused by the withdrawal from year to year of
the amounts due to the long series of heirs, but few of
whom were prepared to retain any interest in the book
business. Several of the sons and grandsons returned to
the old occupation of the Kobergers, and became workers
in gold and silver.</p>

<p>Anthoni Koberger had, in common with the other
printers of Germany, followed Gutenberg in adopting
for his type the style that we describe as Gothic, but
for which the German writers of the time use the term
<i>fractur</i>. In 1492, however, he used for his edition of
<i>Virgil</i> a type based upon a Venetian model, similar
to that in use at this time by the father-in-law of Aldus.
It is probable that the most distinctive contribution which
had been made by Gutenberg to the work of book-printing
was the discovery of a method of making type
by casting. The art of cutting or engraving letters and
other symbols was, of course, no new thing. The technical
training of Fust, himself a goldsmith and stamp-cutter,
was doubtless of material service in connection
with the development of the manufacture of type, as well
as in the production of designs for initials and tail-pieces.
Nuremberg had long been a centre for skilled artificers in
metals, gold, silver, and copper, and their services were
largely made use of by Koberger and other of the earlier
printers.</p>

<p>One result of utilising the letters of known scribes as
models for the fonts of type was to secure for each font
a very distinctive individuality of its own. Luther was,
for instance, able to claim that through the special character
of his Wittenberg type, modelled on the script of
his own scribes, the authorised editions of his books could
be identified, and could be guaranteed as correct and complete.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
The fonts in Koberger’s printing-office did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>include any Greek text, and in the edition of <i>Boëthius</i>,
issued by him in 1576, which was in other respects a
beautiful piece of typography, the lines of quotations
from the Greek were left blank, to be filled in by hand.
Very few of the German printers of the time possessed
any Greek fonts. While Latin was their working language,
the newly revised or newly discovered Greek had
for them still an unfamiliar aspect. Thomas Anshelm,
writing from Hagenau in 1518, says of one of Koberger’s
younger authors: “His style is bad; he is bringing in too
much Greek.” Hans Grüninger, of Strasburg, who took
charge for Koberger of the printing of the great <i>Geography</i>
of Ptolemy, found no little difficulty with the Greek
terms. He writes to the editor, Pirckheimer: “The
Greek is very troublesome, and is costing me altogether
too much.” Pirckheimer on his part complains: “Koberger
promised me that there should be a full supply of
Greek type, and I find out only now, in reading the
proofs, that your type has neither accents nor points.”
In the printing of Greek, the publishers of Venice and of
Paris were at this time considerably in advance of their
German contemporaries.</p>

<p>The leading German publishers of Koberger’s generation
were fortunate in having at hand a number of scholars
who were ready to render service in the selection and
editing of manuscripts, in the collating of texts, and in the
supervision of the work of the typesetters. In the beginning
of the sixteenth century, a man who was competent
to fill the office described in the publishing records as
“press-corrector,” required to possess a varied and comprehensive
scholarship. A mastery of Latin was an acquirement
so usual as not in itself to constitute any claim
to scholarly attainment. With this knowledge, it was,
however, essential, at a time when so large a proportion of
the works printed belonged to the class of theology, for
the corrector to be versed in Hebrew and in Greek. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the typesetters were collected from different parts of
Europe, it was also convenient, if not necessary, for the
man who supervised their work to possess a working
knowledge, at least, of German, French, Italian, and
Dutch. The selection and collation of manuscripts, with
the purpose of securing a fairly correct “copy” for the
printed text, called for a certain measure of skill in palæography,
and also necessitated such familiarity with the
classic writers or Church Fathers as would enable the
more evident blunders of the scribes to be corrected by
the general sense of the context. It was not unusual, as
the records of various of the earlier publishing offices
show, to utilise as the basis of the printed text half a
dozen, or occasionally as many as a dozen manuscripts, in
which case the preparation of the final “copy” for the
typesetters rested with the correctors. Among the scholarly
associates who did work of this kind for the Press of
Koberger, were his friend Amerbach, of Basel; Professor
Frissner, of Leipzig; Pirckheimer, of Nuremberg; Von
Wyle, Wimpfeling, and Beckenhaub. The last named
was an ecclesiastic from Mayence.</p>

<p>Among the responsibilities that came upon the correctors
was that of visiting the libraries or monasteries where
famous manuscripts were preserved, and of arranging,
when practicable, for the hire or the loan of such manuscripts.
When, as was frequently the case, the custodians
were unwilling to permit their parchments to go out of
their hands, the transcripts for the use of the typesetters
had to be prepared (often with considerable difficulty) in
the place where the manuscript was stored—sometimes
even on the old <i>armarium</i> (or library chest) to which the
parchment was chained. Some of these transcripts were
made by the correctors themselves. From time to time,
when it did not seem practicable to arrange for the copying,
we find the publishers offering for the original manuscripts
prices which, under modern calculations, seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
be exorbitant, and which must have constituted a very
serious addition indeed to the risk of these earlier publishing
undertakings.</p>

<p>Pirckheimer writes to Hans Koberger, in 1520, concerning
a manuscript of Fulgentius: “They told me in the
first place that it absolutely could not be bought, but
finally, after increasing our offer step by step to a sum
that I am almost afraid to report to you, I managed to
bring the volume away with me.” In September, 1485,
Busch writes from Italy to Amerbach, who is acting on
behalf of Koberger: “I am sending to you with this what
I believe to be a magnificent copy of the <i>Institutes</i> (of
Cassian), the text of which has been carefully collated.
This parchment must be preserved with exceptional care,
as, if a single spot should come upon it, we should be
liable for heavy damages. It must be returned to me not
later than S. Martin’s Day, and the transcribing must be
done in your own house, from which the parchment must
not be taken.”</p>

<p>Busch appears to have continued to perform this class
of service for Koberger, for we find him, ten years later (in
May, 1495), writing again as follows: “I have succeeded in
getting hold of a beautiful copy of <i>Hugo</i>. I am not allowed
to remove the manuscript, but am having transcripts prepared
from it. I have three good writers employed in the
work, who are able to turn out each six <i>quaternes</i> a week.”
The <i>Hugo</i> here referred to was the text of the <i>Postillas</i> or
commentaries written in the thirteenth century by Cardinal
Hugo, which formed the basis of the great Hugo
edition of the Scriptures, the publication of which was
begun by Koberger in 1497, and was completed in 1504.
The set comprises seven volumes folio. The manuscripts
upon which the text was based and which were doubtless
those referred to by Busch, formed the great treasure of
the library of the Cistercian Monastery at Heilsbronn.
This particular parchment, or series of parchments, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
been written by, or had been written under the direction
of, Abbot Conrad, between the years 1303 and 1329.
The editors who coöperated with Koberger in the production
of the Hugo Bible were, in addition to Amerbach,
Conrad Leontorius, the Humanist Jacob Wimpfeling,
and Heynlin von Stein. For the editing of <i>S. Augustine</i>
Koberger secured the help of Augustin Dodo, and
his edition of <i>S. Jerome</i> was supervised by the great
scholar Reuchlin.</p>

<p>The association of Koberger with Albert Dürer has
already been referred to. Some time before Koberger’s
book-presses began their work in Nuremberg, Dürer had
been using hand-presses for the impressions of his woodcuts
and of his designs engraved on copper. Hase is of
opinion that Dürer gave direct coöperation in Koberger’s
press-room, and that the excellence and evenness of print
of the Koberger editions may be very largely credited to
Dürer’s artistic supervision.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>At least one work remains which bears the imprint of
Dürer as printer. A volume containing the <i>Book of Revelation</i>
bears on its title-page, <i>Gedrücket zu Nürnberg
durch Albrecht Dürer, Maler, nach Christi Geburt MCCCC.
und danach im XCVIII. jahr</i>. There is, however, no
record of the establishment of any book-printing-office
under Dürer’s ownership, and it seems probable that the
volume in question was printed on a Koberger press
under Dürer’s supervision.</p>

<p>A few years later, we shall find the artist and engraver
Cranach associating himself in a similar manner with the
work of Luther’s printers in Wittenberg. The connection
between the work of designers who were also engravers
and who usually did the printing of their own impressions,
and that of the book-printers in whose volumes many of
the same designs were included, is a very obvious one.</p>

<p>After the time of the close of the business of the Kobergers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>a considerable change took place in the character of
the publications issued in Germany. A continually increasing
proportion of these were printed in German, while
the costly folios, quartos, and octavos were to a very
great extent replaced by low-priced duodecimos, cheap
pamphlets and tracts (<i>Flugschriften</i>). The burning issues
brought to the front by the Reformers were of interest not
only to scholars, but to the mass of the people, and to
supply information on these issues called for reading-matter
printed in the vernacular, and in the cheapest possible
form. There would not, at first thought, seem to be any
reason why this new demand for cheap books on the part
of the masses should lessen the sale to the educated classes
of literature in more costly and permanent form. This
was, however, certainly the effect during the quarter of
a century in which the earlier issues of the Reformation
were fought over. The Reformers had their hands full
with the controversy. They were making Church history,
and had little time for the study of the history of the
Church in past centuries. The writings of the Fathers of
the Church, who were the spiritual ancestors of the Protestants
no less than of the Catholics, were for the time put
to one side, although some years later they again found
place in the libraries and in the university work of the
Protestants. For the study of the philosophy of the
schoolmen and for a proper appreciation of the literature
of classic times, the period of the Reformation was likewise
unfavourable. Philosophy and poetry demand periods of
leisure and cannot be pursued to advantage during periods
of civil and religious strife.</p>

<p>The bearing of these influences upon the publishing
conditions of Germany in the sixteenth century is obvious.
There was, after 1517, an enormous increase in the circulation
of printed matter and a very great development in
the habit of reading on the part of the people at large,
and the intellectual activities engendered by the popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
interest in the religious and ecclesiastical controversies had
in the end a very important part in furthering the growth of
the literary and the publishing activities of Germany. During
the earlier years of the contest, however, the first result
was an actual diminution in the demand in Germany for
the class of books to the production of which publishers
of the higher grade had devoted themselves. Some of
the firms, who could not easily adapt themselves to the
new conditions, or who did not find themselves in sympathy
with the new influences, decided, like the Kobergers, to
retire altogether. New men took the lead in the publishing
business of Germany. The first period in the age
of printing, the period in which its service had been
rendered almost exclusively to scholars, came to a close.
German replaced Latin, and the Press became the servant
of the people at large.</p>

<p>In the general course of Koberger’s publishing undertakings,
the question of compensation for authors, or at
least for original work of authors, could have arisen but
very seldom, and in this respect his experience was identical
with that of publishers generally in his generation.
Their publications consisted chiefly, and with some firms
exclusively, of works of an earlier time, the authors of
which had long been dead; in the limited instances in
which they used their presses for the books of living
writers, the main purpose of these writers was to bring
their productions before the public, and they considered
themselves under obligations to the publishers who were
willing to incur the risk and expense of the undertaking.
The books written by the few authors of Koberger’s
generation were for the most part works of doctrine or
having a dogmatic purpose of some kind. The object
of their production was not the possibility of gain, but the
influencing of public opinion, the furthering of a cause,
the overthrow of abuses, or the defence of institutions
that had been assailed. For such aims the chief thing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
almost the only thing, to be considered was the securing
of as wide a circulation as possible. Apart from this consideration,
these writers might easily have considered it
presumptuous to expect compensation for the publication
of their productions, when the publishers had available
for their use all the literary heritage of antiquity, together
with the long series of writings of the Church Fathers.
It was also, of course, the case that under the publishing
and bookselling conditions of the time, when it was by no
means easy to bring effectively before a reading public
the works of authors whose names were famous in literature
or in the records of the Church, the difficulty must
have been enormously greater in the case of books, however
distinctive in themselves, by writers who were not
known to the public. There was, in fact, no adequate
machinery for bringing new books to the attention of
possible readers. Many years were still to elapse before
anything in the shape of a periodical came into existence,
and in the impossibility of reviews or of advertisements,
there was no way of giving or of distributing information
about new books except by word of mouth or by personal
correspondence.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind that I am speaking of the
years immediately preceding the Reformation. The enormous
public interest aroused by the writings of Luther
and his associates brought about an immediate change in
publishing methods and possibilities, a change which will
be described in a later chapter. The books of Erasmus,
which in large part preceded the Lutheran writings, must
be considered as having constituted a noteworthy exception
to the literary conditions of his time. Their record
also will be given farther on. It remained the case, however,
that with a few inconsiderable exceptions, the only
moneys paid to authors by the first Koberger were for
editorial service. Hase mentions that in the production
of the great <i>Chronicle</i> of Schedel, funds had to be provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
only for the illustrations and for the printing, the
compiler, Hartmann Schedel, and his associate, George
Alt, being willing to accept their compensation in the form
of sets of the work.</p>

<p>The scholars of the Humanistic school had made it
their chief interest to further the production and the
understanding of the works of the classic writers, and
when the influence of the Reformation brought about a
reaction against the influence of the literature of Greece
and Rome, these Humanist scholars found their special
occupation gone. Many of them sought occupation on
the staffs of the publishers and earned a livelihood in
editorial service of a different character, or sometimes in
purely hack work in collating and proof-reading. When
the Basel edition of <i>S. Jerome</i> was in preparation, Amerbach
applied to Reuchlin for aid in connection with the
printing of the Hebrew portions, and wrote, “We shall be
very ready to pay for your help whatever you may ask.”
Reuchlin had shortly before completed the publication of
his <i>Rudimenta</i>. The work had been undertaken at the
author’s cost, and as the sales were but small, he found himself
in trouble with his printer, Anshelm. He wrote to his
good friend Amerbach, “I shall be well pleased to do the
editorial work required for the <i>Jerome</i> without compensation
if you will relieve me from the claims of this troublesome
Anshelm.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> It is evident that Reuchlin, while
imagining that he was publishing his <i>Rudimenta</i> at his
own risk, had in fact left the payment of the printer’s bill
to be contingent upon the sales of the book, having no other
resources available, and the printer had, therefore, been
made involuntarily a sharer of the risk, while if the work
had succeeded, he would have been entitled to no share
in the profits. Anshelm’s account must, however, have
been settled by Amerbach, in consideration of the work
done by Reuchlin on the <i>Jerome</i>, as we find him, later,
again in friendly relations with the Hebrew scholar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>
<p>Shortly after the death of Anthoni Koberger, we begin
to find more frequent references in the correspondence of
the publishers of Germany to compensation for original
literary work. Boniface Amerbach had recommended
to Froben the <i>Lucubrations</i> of Zasius, and writes in 1518
concerning the author: “Zasius thinks that he ought to
be paid for this work, and speaks of thirty florins as a
proper price. I should, however, not assent to any such
demand. He is anxious to get his book into print, and
had said before that he should expect to be paid well if
it succeeded, and should be quite ready to accept little or
nothing if it failed to sell, a result which, however, he
could not believe possible.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> In 1524, Hans Koberger arranged
with Zasius, through Dr. Roth, for the publication
of the <i>Intellectus Juris</i>. He first offered as honorarium
fifty or sixty copies of the book. To this suggestion
Zasius replied: “I must have my honorarium in hard
cash.... I have had an enormous amount of labour
and pains in getting this material into shape, and I ought
to receive not less than fifty guldens.” This was an early
instance of the very natural, though not very reasonable,
expectation or requirement on the part of the author that
his compensation ought to be based upon the extent of
the labour given to the book, instead of upon the return
that the public was willing to make for the book itself.</p>

<p>Koberger did not come to terms for the <i>Intellectus
Juris</i>, and it was finally published by Cratander, who
paid for it twenty florins. Zasius does not appear, however,
to have got along very well with Cratander, for we
find him a little later breaking away from him with the
word, “The devil take the printers [<i>zum Teufel mit deinen
Drückern</i>], who never have treated me decently.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Zasius
appears to have had his full share of the <i>genus irritabile</i>.
Some expressions in his correspondence recall the references
made by Martial to his four publishers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>He was a near friend of Zwingli, and a number of
the letters preserved in the <i>Epistolæ</i> were addressed to
Zwingli. Zasius was in sympathy with the earlier efforts
of the Reformers against the abuses that had crept into
the Church, but he held with Erasmus that the duty
of Christians was to reform and not to destroy or to
divide the Church.</p>

<p>The authors were doubtless in a position in many cases
to dispose of their free copies for money. It is evident,
however, from the literary correspondence of the time,
that the practice was very general on the part of authors
of sending complimentary copies to each other, a practice
which, as developed, came to absorb a substantial portion
of the edition. Authors were able to build up their
libraries with books received in exchange, but collections
of books, however essential or desirable, did not help
directly towards income. This distribution of complimentary
copies became naturally a still more considerable
item when there was question, not simply of an exchange
of scholarly compliments, but of the widest possible distribution
of a teaching or a doctrine. Thus Luther is
described as giving away whole editions of certain of his
monographs, which he could do the more easily as the
editions printed in Wittenberg were, for the most part,
the property of the author.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The practice of securing money presents in consideration
of dedications or of eulogies printed in prefatory
epistles, seems to have played an important part in the
calculations of certain classes of authors during the first
half of the sixteenth century. Cuspinian writes to Pirckheimer,
in 1501, asking counsel concerning the advisability
of dedicating the first volume of a work he had in
press with Koberger to the chief magistrate of Nuremberg.
Pirckheimer tells his friend that some more advantageous
patron could doubtless be found. “You must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>remember,” he writes, “that we are here a very commercial
people ... and some among our magistrates
hardly understand what literature is.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Five years
earlier, however, Martin Behaim (or Behem) had received
from the Nuremberg magistrate of that day a gift of
twenty-four florins for some honourable mention of the
magistrate’s name on his big map of the world.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> A year
or two earlier, namely in 1488, the magistrates in Nuremberg
had given to Siegmund Mensterlin thirty-seven
florins for his <i>Chronicle</i> of the city. This may, however,
be considered in the light of a direct payment for a service
to the city, rather than as an honorarium for a compliment.
In 1502, Conrad Celtes received in like manner
from the treasury in Nuremberg the sum of twenty florins,
“for his labour in the description of our city and for the
record of its origin.”</p>

<p>The general question whether it befitted the dignity of
authors (considered possibly not so much in the light of
literary producers as of gentlemen who had happened to
interest themselves in literature) to receive compensation
for their work, was a matter of debate during a large part
of the sixteenth century. It was inevitable, while all the
conditions of literary production and distribution were
still to be shaped, and while the difficulties of estimating
with any degree of accuracy the possibilities of securing
commercial returns for literary productions were still so
great, that many questions concerning the division of
ownership and returns, when any returns accrued, must
arise and must for some time remain unsettled. The
whole matter of compensation for literary service remained,
therefore, during the period between the beginning
of printing and the establishment of some system of
control of the books printed, in a hap-hazard and anomalous
condition. We find authors of one group, whose
interest is limited exclusively to the circulation of sound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>doctrine, wondering that any writers of doctrinal works
could permit themselves to receive pay for bringing the
truth to mankind. We find other equally unselfish but
more far-seeing authors like Luther and Melanchthon, accepting
pay for books sold, if only for the purpose of instituting
a larger production and a wider distribution of
similar books. We find writers devoting their pens to the
defence of the Roman Church unwilling to accept any
returns from their booksellers, but quite ready to receive
compensation for their labours in the form of presents of
money from pope, cardinals, or bishops. Other authors,
such as Cuspinian, whose letter has been quoted, who considered
it beneath their dignity to make an agreement
with their publishers for a royalty or an honorarium, were
quite willing to utilise their pens in the composition of
high-flown complimentary epistles or of fulsome dedications,
which were, as they hoped, to result in bringing to
the writers substantial presents from the patrons thus
flattered. In the bitter controversy which Ulrich von
Hutten, in the last year of his life, carried on with Erasmus,
and in the course of which the knight took pains to
bring together a long series of invectives, he found no
ground for criticism in the relations borne by Erasmus to
various patrons for whose gifts he had been a supplicant,
but thought he could say nothing more invidious of his
scholarly opponent than that he had received moneys from
the publisher Froben, moneys which had been earned by
the sale of the works of Erasmus.</p>

<p>The point of view and the standard of action were,
however, in the course of a few years to be materially
changed. The organisation of the German book-trade,
carrying with it a substantial though by no means complete
measure of protection for the productions of each of
the publishers taking part in the organisation, had as its
immediate result a great development in literary production,
in the circulation of books, and in the extent of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
returns secured. A later and hardly less important result
was the securing for original literature of an assured business
foundation. Literary producers, thus placed in a
position to secure a compensation for their labours proportioned
to the extent of the value placed by the community
upon their production, were freed from the
necessity of earlier years, of seeking gifts and of depending
upon patrons.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">FROBEN OF BASEL.</p>

<p class="center">1460-1528.</p>
</div>

<p class="noin dropcap">JOHANN FROBEN, who achieved a well-deserved
reputation as one of the most enlightened and enterprising
publishers of the sixteenth century, and
who will be remembered as having been honoured with
the friendship and confidence of Erasmus, was born in
1460, in Hammelburg, a village in Franconia. He studied
in the University of Basel (which had been founded the
year before his birth), and achieved distinction as a scholar
in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He was trained as type-setter
and press-corrector by the famous printer Amerbach,
and thus equipped, he secured citizenship in Basel in 1490,
and in the following year began business in his own name as
a master printer and publisher. Gutenberg had been dead
for twenty years, but the business established by Fust and
Schöffer with the original Gutenberg plant (representing
the earliest printing concern in Europe) was still being
carried on by the son of Schöffer. The work of Caxton,
which had been begun in Bruges in 1470, had, in 1474,
been transferred to London, and closed with his death in
1492, the year in which Aldus Manutius began his printing
operations in Venice. In Paris the leading typographer
of the town was Badius, the predecessor of the more
famous Estiennes.</p>

<p>At the time Froben began his work, the methods of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
carrying on a printing-office, and the machinery for the
production and distribution of books, were still to be
established. Type-setters, pressmen, and correctors were
all to be trained, and every technical detail of the work of
book-making called for the personal supervision and often
for the individual inventiveness of the master. Upon him
came also of necessity the responsibility for the selection
of the work to be undertaken, the securing of text for
“copy,” the collation and preparation of the “copy” for
the type-setters, and an unremitting watchfulness over each
page as put into type. It is to be borne in mind that
nearly all the earlier books were printed in Latin, which
for the majority of the Swiss or German compositors was
an unfamiliar tongue, a circumstance that very seriously
increased the risk of type-setting errors. It is surprising
that in the face of difficulties of this kind, the books of
the fifteenth century present, with rare exceptions, a fairly
correct text.</p>

<p>Froben’s first publication was a Latin Bible in convenient
octavo form. The several earlier Bibles had been
issued in folio, and this less costly edition won for itself
at once a widespread appreciation. Froben’s undertakings
were restricted to books in Latin and Greek—that is, to
works addressed to scholars. He left to later publishers
the task of preparing books in the vernacular for the unlearned
reader. In fact, the interest of the latter in 1492,
was in the main limited to almanacs, horn-books, legends,
and such picturesque compendiums as the <i>Sachsen-Spiegel</i>.
For general literature, the common folk was not yet ready.
The educational influence of the Reformation was required
to arouse the intelligence of the people and to
induce a popular demand for reading-matter.</p>

<p>In 1500, Froben, then forty years of age, married Gertrude,
the daughter of a prosperous bookseller named
Lachner. The latter supplied means for the extension of
the printing-office in which, in 1504, seven presses were at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
work. During the thirty-six years of the business career
of Froben, he printed no less than two hundred and fifty-seven
separate works, many of these being of distinctive
importance and of considerable compass. Among these
were the complete works of S. Jerome, which appeared in
1516 in nine folio volumes; the works of S. Augustine,
completed in 1529, in ten folio volumes; the New Testament
in Greek (this was the first edition of the Greek text,
and it was, later, utilised by Luther in the preparation of
his German version); and the writings of Erasmus, who
appears to be the only contemporary author whose books
were undertaken by Froben. These proved to be good
property for both the author and publishers, as Erasmus
was addressing himself to the scholarly readers of the
civilised world, and his writings were eagerly read throughout
Europe by both the clergy and the laity. In addition
to the authorised editions issued in Basel, Venice, and Paris,
there were many piracy reprints, but notwithstanding
the competition of these, the author was able to secure
from his three publishers, Froben, Aldus, and Badius
of Paris, returns that made a material addition to his
income. He was probably the first author in Europe,
writing after the invention of printing, who made any
money by his pen. Froben secured the coöperation, in
the course of his publishing work, of a number of learned
associates who rendered assistance as literary advisers,
editors, and press-correctors, the list including, among
other scholars, Erasmus (who was for many years an inmate
of his house), Oecolampadius, Heiland, Musculus,
and Gelenius. To Froben also is to be credited the discovery
of Hans Holbein. Holbein was born in Grünstadt
in 1497, and came to Basel about 1517, with the view of
making his living as a wood-engraver. Froben was one of
the first to give him employment, and many of the designs
in the Froben books issued between 1518 and 1522
were both drawn and engraved by young Holbein. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
was through Froben that the talent of the young artist
was brought to the attention of Erasmus, and Erasmus
was the means of securing an invitation from Sir Thomas
More for Holbein to visit England, where he spent the rest
of his life and where his most important art-work was
done. King Henry VIII. attached him to the Court and
bestowed on him a pension.</p>

<p>Froben’s list included a number of “orthodox” theological
works, and remaining as he did in the fold of the
Church, the influence of his Press was as a whole exercised
consistently against the doctrines of the Reformers. His
imprint appears never to have been associated with any of
the doctrinal books or tractates of the Lutherans, Calvinists,
or Zwinglians.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Not a few of Froben’s more costly
publications were undertaken in coöperation with other
publishers, a kind of partnership agreement being entered
into for each particular book taken up in this manner.
His more important associates were Johann Amerbach,
who took high rank among the scholarly printers of the
time, Johann Petri, also of Basel, and Franz Birckmann of
Cologne. This method of dividing the risk of an undertaking
between several publishing concerns became, later,
a very general practice with the publishers of London.</p>

<p>Erasmus, writing from Basel, in 1523, to Vergilius Polydorus,
says: “I find here three methods of bringing a
book into print. Sometimes Froben takes upon himself
the entire risk and outlay.... In other cases the
publication is undertaken for the account of some person
interested, and Froben simply reserves a commission for
his services; and under a third arrangement, the publication
is undertaken by two or more firms, associated as
a temporary company.... It is now being considered
in Paris whether this book of yours [Erasmus does
not mention the title of the book] is to be published by
Birckmann alone, or by the ‘Company.’ As soon as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>Froben has returned from the Fair (at Frankfort) I will
write to you what the decision has been. I hope that I
shall be able to arrange the matter to your best advantage.”
Whatever may have been the pressure of work in
the Froben printing-office, either in connection with the
completion of books for the Frankfort Fair, or for any
other cause, there appears never to have been question of
postponing the publications of any of the writings of
Erasmus himself. For these the presses were always
ready because for these there was always a waiting public.</p>

<p>A year or two later Erasmus writes: “Froben is expending
enormous sums for manuscripts and for collation
and revision of these.” Among the revisers referred to
in this statement was the famous scholar Beatus Rhenanus,
who having studied philosophy in Paris and sojourned
for a brief period in Strasburg, had migrated to
Basel, and was devoting himself exclusively to the work
of the Froben Press. He served not only as a reviser
and press-corrector, but as a literary counsellor, to whose
suggestions were due a number of Froben’s scholarly
undertakings. Erasmus speaks with high regard of his
learning and conscientiousness and of the value for Froben
of his coöperation.</p>

<p>One of the charges made by Ulrich von Hutten in his
little controversy with Erasmus (a controversy in which
the last word was the <i>Spongia</i>, or <i>Sponge</i>, of the latter) was
that he received money for work done for a printer. The
charge was well founded, for Froben paid Erasmus two
hundred guldens a year for his services as editor or reviser.
It does not appear from the records that have
been preserved whether he received, in addition, his
board and lodging during the time that he sojourned in
his publisher’s house, or whether there was for this a
separate arrangement. There is also no precise statement
concerning the receipts that came to Erasmus from the
sale of Froben’s editions of his books, but the scholar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
makes a number of appreciative references to the effective
service rendered by his Basel publishers and to the importance
of these receipts. It is evident from the phrases
used by the pugnacious Von Hutten that the earning of
money by labour was still considered by many as something
unbecoming a man of gentle birth or gentle station,—and,
as before said, Erasmus was one of the first of
European authors who had secured an income from the
work of his pen. It would be more exact to say, from
the sale of his own productions, for a considerable number
of scholars of his generation were accepting compensation
for services as editors and press-correctors.</p>

<p>Kapp is of opinion that Luther, whose writings secured
a wider circulation than even those of Erasmus, never
accepted any honorarium, and that his compensation for
his books was limited<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> to a few complimentary copies.
Luther speaks of “the exceptional greed” of a translator
who secured a gold gulden for the rendering of a quarto.
The number of pages is not specified, but we may hope,
for the sake of the translator, that the quarto was a thin
one.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> On the other hand, Thomas Murner sold his
<i>Geuchmatt</i> to the Strasburg publisher, Hupfuff, in 1514,
for four guldens, a sum which Kapp estimates as the
equivalent of forty guldens to-day. I will give consideration
in a later chapter to the data that have been preserved
concerning the general compensation secured in Germany
during the century succeeding Gutenberg for literary or
editorial work. The first of the books of Erasmus to be
issued by Froben was the famous <i>Encomium Moriæ</i> (<i>The
Praise of Folly</i>), printed in 1515. Of the first Basel edition,
1800 copies were sold in the first six months. The
Latin version was printed also by Aldus in Venice and
by Badius in Paris. A German version was speedily
issued, illustrated with designs by Holbein, and this was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>followed by translations in French and Dutch. During
the lifetime of the author, no less than twenty-seven
editions appeared, the larger number of which were unauthorised
and brought to the author no returns. <i>The
Praise of Folly</i> was the first printed book that secured
during the lifetime of its author what may be called a
“world-wide circulation,” which for the “world” of that
time was practically limited to Europe. The circulation
of many of the treatises of Luther was very great, but
these found their way to few but Protestant readers,
while in its original Latin and in the various versions in
the vernacular, <i>The Praise of Folly</i> was welcomed in all
circles—Protestant, Catholic, lay and ecclesiastical, scholarly
and unlearned. <i>The Praise of Folly</i> has taken its
place with the world’s literature, but a still greater success
with the generation of the author was secured by the next
book of Erasmus, the <i>Adagia</i>, or <i>Proverbs</i>. Of this there
were printed in the authorised editions, by Froben, between
1513 and 1539, ten thousand; by Aldus, in Venice,
between 1508 and 1524, eight thousand; by Schürer, in
Strasburg, between 1513 and 1520, eleven thousand; by
Badius and Philippus, in Paris, three thousand; or, in all,
thirty-two thousand copies. There were also a number of
unauthorised editions issued in Lyons, Cologne, and elsewhere,
the statistics of which are not available.</p>

<p>The third of the more important works of Erasmus, the
<i>Colloquia</i>, which may be described as a kind of predecessor
of Landor’s <i>Imaginary Conversations</i>, also published in
Basel, Venice, and Paris, found a sale (for the authorised
editions) in a term of ten years, of about twenty-four
thousand copies. The demand for this was hastened by
the rumour that it was shortly to be placed on the <i>Index
Expurgatorius</i>.</p>

<p>Erasmus speaks of Froben as “the Aldus of Germany,”
and can give him no higher commendation. Froben had
selected for his publishing symbol or trade-mark a design<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
representing an upright staff on the point of which rests
a dove, about which are twined two serpents with their
heads raised towards the dove. It is not difficult to
imagine the kind of interpretation that would be given
by the wits of a modern authors’ society to such a symbol,
with its suggestion of the innocent and hapless author
lifting his aspirations towards the heavens, but powerless
to escape the toils of the wily publishers of the earth,
earthy. No such criticism appears, however, to have
arisen in the sixteenth century to disturb Froben’s peace
of mind.</p>

<p>His best friend, the most influential author of his time,
expresses the wish that his serpents may prove as serviceable
for Froben as the dolphin has been for Aldus, and
that in combining, as he does, the innocence of the dove
with the wisdom of the serpent, Froben may achieve a
well-earned fame and future.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Rhenanus, Mutianus,
Rufus, and many others of those who were proud to call
themselves the <i>Auctores Frobeniani</i>, are all in accord in
their appreciative references to the high literary ideals,
the thorough scholarship, and the liberal business methods
of the great Basel publisher.</p>

<p>I insert here certain letters from Zwingli to Beatus
Rhenanus, which have a bearing upon the esteem in
which Froben was held by his literary friends, and which
contain also some interesting references to the books
most desired by Zwingli.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Just as I was about to publish the little book of C.
Cornelius Tacitus upon the customs and locations of the
Germanic tribes, a friend [Beatus Rhenanus] showed me
a brief commentary which he had prepared stating who
now live in the locations described by Tacitus. This
seemed to me to be a good idea, as it is a mistake to confine
one’s reading to the more ancient authors to the
neglect of those less remote. Think of the changes which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
have occurred since Cæsar’s day! Therefore, while his
<i>Commentaries</i> are worthy of the highest praise in point
of truthfulness and style, yet it is necessary to read also
Spartianus, Vopiscus, Trebellius Pollio, Ammianus Marcellinus,
and Eutropius Procopius. Surely, if Cæsar were
to return from the shades, he would scarcely recognise his
former localities. The races have become so mixed, the
population so changed, partly through destruction and
partly through transplanting, that I may say all things
are different. Because I know that you interrupt your
higher studies to nibble on tit-bits of this description, I
dedicate to you this commentary, which students will find
useful. Thus light has been shed upon antiquity by the
labours of the Swiss scholars, two of whom should especially
be mentioned, Henricus Glareanus, my dear friend,

<p>Rhenanus, in referring to the intimate relation between
Erasmus and Froben, speaks of it as a friendship
between the prince of scholars and the prince of publishers.
The circle of intimates who were gathered about
the two “princes” during the nine years of the sojourn
of Erasmus in Basel (1521-1530) included the brothers
Amerbach, Glareanus, Oecolampadius, Rhenanus, Listrius,
Gerbelius, Fontejus, and Eobanus Hessius. The
older Amerbach, who coöperated with Froben in many of
his more important publications, trained three sons to
take responsibilities in the editorial division of his business.
One became an expert in Greek, the second in
Latin, the third in Hebrew. One of the books in which
the Amerbachs took an important part was the great
edition of the works of S. Jerome. Concerning this,
Erasmus writes in April, 1515, to Pope Leo X.: “A
great work is being carried on in this city, in the establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
of Froben, most trustworthy and most capable
of all publishers; S. Jerome is again in life and his words
are to be freshly given to the world. Providence itself
appears to have brought this firm into existence, in order
again to cause to be felt the influence of S. Jerome. Froben
himself, Amerbach and his three sons are devoting
their whole energies to the undertaking.”</p>

<p>Through the influence of Erasmus, a papal privilege
was secured in the name of Froben, for the works of
Jerome for a term of five years, for which privilege six
ducats had to be paid. The publication of the <i>Jerome</i>
was a notable event in the world of scholarship and in
ecclesiastical circles and brought great prestige to the
Basel publisher. Many congratulatory letters were received
from all parts of Europe. Dorpius, writing in
July, 1515, to Erasmus, asks the latter to give to Froben,
“chief among printers,” a cordial greeting for the great
services rendered by him to the Church and to learning.
“May the Lord give to him,” he continues, “many long
years in which to carry on his noble undertakings.”
Erasmus himself, writing to Feltichius, in December,
1526, says: “No one who has not been intimately associated
with my friend Froben, can fairly realise the extent
of his devotion to good work and the toilsome labour
that he has given to his undertakings. The world has
never seen a publisher who has striven so earnestly and
so unselfishly in the cause of scholarship.” After the
death of Froben, which occurred in 1528, Erasmus writes
again: “We have lost Froben, that most exceptional
man. His life was devoted to earnest and conscientious
labours and he died at his work.... For the past
eight years I have been his house guest and have had
with him the most cordial friendship. A truer friend than
Froben, I could not wish from the Gods. For the family
that he has left I feel for his sake a cordial affection.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Writing in August, 1531, to Jerome, the son of Froben,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Erasmus says: “Many virtues possessed Johann
Froben of blessed memory, but through nothing did he
bring himself to me so closely as in this, that he gave the
devotion of his life to the task of bringing to the world
the best literature; a task in furthering which, his death
came to him.... So it resulted that he gave more
thought to his scholarly ideals than to his own fortunes,
and thus has left to his heirs a great repute but a small
estate.... Now that I understand that his son has
inherited his high purposes, so can I assure this son that
the good will and coöperation which I extended to his
father will not be intermitted for him.”</p>

<p>One of the most important of the works which was left
unfinished at the time of Froben’s death and to which
his own last working hours had been given, was the
edition of <i>S. Augustine</i>, which was to form a companion
to the works of S. Jerome. The <i>S. Augustine</i> was published
by Froben’s son with the coöperation of the
younger Amerbachs and with the all-important aid also
of Erasmus and Rhenanus. Erasmus exerted himself to
secure for the <i>S. Augustine</i> a privilege for France, but for
some reason not given this privilege was denied. Erasmus
does not mention what amount he received for his
editorial service in the undertaking, but (writing in September,
1528) says that he would not have undertaken
such a task for two thousand guldens. According to
Kapp, he refused to receive from Froben the elder more
than one third of the annual payments that the publisher
wanted to make to him, and he also refused to accept a
house which Froben had tendered to him as a gift. The
entire relation between the two men forms a noteworthy
episode in the somewhat chequered history of authors
and publishers.</p>

<p>Froben had at one time taken up the publication of
the writings of Luther. On the fourteenth of February,
1519, he writes to Luther that he has made very large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
sales of Luther’s books in France, Spain, Italy, Brabant,
and England.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This reference is to the first collection of
Luther’s writings, which had been printed by Froben in
October, 1518, and of which further impressions were
made in August, 1519, and in March, 1520. After 1520,
Froben prints no further books for Luther, although it is
evident that an assured and increasing sale was being
secured for these. It is probable that he was influenced
to this decision by the counsels of Erasmus and in connection
with his relations to Leo X. It seems evident
that Froben, while not a bigoted Romanist, had not been
attracted by the doctrines of the Reformers. Irrespective
of his long personal association with Erasmus, it is probable
that his own scholarly temperament and direction of
thought would have brought him into sympathy rather
with the views of the scholar of Rotterdam than with
those of the monk of Wittenberg. He believed that the
Church was to be set right not by being broken into fragments,
but by being brought back to the teachings of its
founders and of their successors, the Fathers, and he was
prepared to do his part in this work of reform and of re-inspiration
by devoting his life and his fortunes to the
task of presenting to believers these teachings in accurate
and accessible texts. Froben’s editions of the Scriptures,
the works of S. Jerome and of S. Augustine and of other
of the Fathers, and his issues of the books of Erasmus,
to the production of which he devoted a lifetime of conscientious
toil, constituted the publisher’s contribution to
the settlement of the vexed questions which were bringing
turmoil upon Europe and by which the Church was
rent in twain. But the contest was too bitter, and the
passions it had aroused were too fierce to make it possible
for either the wisdom of the Fathers or the scholarship
and wit of Erasmus to be of much present service in
furthering a peaceable outcome.</p>

<p class="center">ERASMUS AND HIS BOOKS.</p>

<p class="center">1467-1536.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">IT is convenient to make in this place such further reference
as is pertinent to my subject to the literary
undertakings of Erasmus, of whom I have before spoken
as perhaps the most typical author of his time. In popularity,
as far as popularity is to be gauged by extent of
circulation, his books were excelled only by the writings
of Luther, while the range of their distribution—that is,
the extent of the territory reached and the variety of the
circles of readers by whom they were welcomed—must
have been much in advance of anything attained by the
writings of Luther. The direct influence of these last
was, for a long time at least, limited to Germany and to
the Low Countries, while their principal sale was in the
common tongue and among the masses of the people.
The writings of Erasmus, in their original Latin form,
found their way in the first place to the educated circles
of the upper classes, and to the more liberal minded of
the ecclesiastics, while the versions in the vernacular
which speedily followed, in both authorised and unauthorised
editions, were taken up with cordial appreciation
by all classes of readers throughout Europe.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly the case that, while Erasmus always
refused to take sides with the Protestants and held himself
to be a dutiful son of the Catholic Church, the influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
of his writings was a most important factor in
bringing about the conditions that made the Reformation
possible. Drummond speaks of the <i>Praise of Folly</i> as
“the first decisive trumpet-blast summoning the friends
of right and learning to gird on their armour, and heralding
the advance of that reforming spirit with which the
Papal power was destined ere long to engage in deadly
and terrible encounter.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It would, however, be outside
of the plan of this study to go into the question of the
relations of Erasmus to the Reformation, a theme which
has been treated with full knowledge and excellent critical
judgment in the scholarly biography of Mr. Drummond,
and more recently, with less thoroughness, but with no
little force and suggestiveness, in the brilliant biographical
study of Mr. Froude.</p>

<p>The following are the dates of the more important
events in the career of the man who is to be described,
not only as a great scholar but as the most successful and
influential author of his age. He was born in Rotterdam
in 1467, seventeen years after Gutenberg had printed his
first book. He was placed as a boy at the school carried
on at Deventer by the Brothers of Common Life. The
interest taken by this fraternity in the multiplication and
circulation of literature, and the importance of its publishing
undertakings both during the manuscript period and
after the beginning of printing, have already been noted.</p>

<p>In 1485, when he was eighteen years old, Erasmus took
vows as a monk of the Order of S. Augustine (the same
Order to which, later, Luther belonged), vows from which
a number of years afterwards he was released by Pope
Leo X. In 1492, through the favour of the Bishop of
Cambray, he was enabled to pass some years at the University
of Paris, which, though at that time not a little degenerated,
was still the leading university of Europe. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
1498, Erasmus made his first visit to England, where he remained
nearly two years, chiefly in Oxford, and where he
was at once brought into relations with a number of famous
men, some of whom became valued friends, such as
Thomas Linacre, William Grocyn, John Colet, and Sir
Thomas More. In 1500, Erasmus, then again in Paris,
published the first edition of the <i>Adagia</i>, a collection of
proverbs, which became in its subsequent and enlarged
issues a very different work from the first small volume.</p>

<p>In 1506, Erasmus made his first visit to Italy, and received
at Bologna the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He
remained at Venice, in the house of the publisher Aldus,
until 1509, and published through Aldus, in 1508, the enlarged
edition of the <i>Adagia</i>. In the latter part of 1509
he is again in England, living with his friend More, and
publishes the famous satire, <i>The Praise of Folly</i> (<i>Encomium
Moriæ</i>).</p>

<p>In 1514, Erasmus makes his first sojourn in Basel, and
begins the intimacy with Froben which was to continue
during the lifetime of the latter. In 1516, he prints, in
Basel, <i>The New Testament</i> in Greek and Latin; this was
the first time the complete Greek text had been put into
type.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In 1517, Erasmus takes up his residence for a time
at the University of Louvain, and during the two or three
years following, devotes much earnest correspondence to
the Lutheran controversies. He is still at Louvain in
1520, but in 1521, at the time of the Diet of Worms, he
removes to Basel, where he takes up his abode with his
good friend Froben, with whom he remains until Froben’s
death in 1527. In 1529, he moves to Friburg, but in 1534,
he returns to Basel, where he died in 1536.</p>

<p>The <i>Adagia</i>, the first of the books of Erasmus which
brought him into fame, was originally printed in Paris in
1500. Drummond is of opinion that this first edition was
put together hurriedly for the purpose of recruiting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>exhausted finances of its author by means of a publication
which was “sure to sell.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It seems evident that
Erasmus considered the receipts from its sale important,
but he fails to mention the amount actually realised or
the nature of the several publishing arrangements under
which it was published. Several references give the impression,
however, that the author himself retained the
ownership of his Paris edition. He writes in 1504 to
Colet, Dean of St. Paul’s, asking the Dean to look up for
him the matter of one hundred copies of the <i>Adagia</i> sent
to London three years back, for “which he had received
no returns.” He understands the copies have all been
sold, and concludes, not unnaturally, that “somebody
must have got the money.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> He makes no later reference
to the business, and we may therefore hope that
the books were finally paid for.</p>

<p>While it is certain that Erasmus secured considerable
sums for the sale of the <i>Adagia</i>, and, later, from the <i>Encomium
Moriæ</i>, it is equally clear that during all the
earlier portion of his life he was in continued need of
money, and in addition to accepting with expectant gratitude
presents from various friends, he found occasion for
frequent applications for gifts to other friends and to possible
patrons. From the point of view of to-day, many
of these letters appear to be seriously lacking in the
dignity and self-respect which ought to have characterised
a great author and an intellectual leader. It
would however be very absurd to arrive at a judgment
in the matter from the standpoint of the nineteenth century,
when from the vantage-ground of an assured copyright
protection, authors are able to dictate terms to
publishers and readers. In applying to people of wealth
for means with which to continue or extend his studies,
Erasmus feels evidently that he is asking help not so
much for himself personally, as for the literature and
scholarship of which he is the representative. It is an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>appeal for the endowment of research. He appears also to
have possessed no capacity for keeping a balance-sheet, or
for a business-like management of his resources, and when
money did come into his hands, it disappeared very
rapidly. It is to be remembered that while he was willing
to beg, and was ready for the sake of financial aid to
write flattering letters to possible patrons, he appears
never to have been willing to sacrifice for the favour of
such patrons any measure of conviction or of consistency.
On various occasions he put to one side opportunities for
gain or for advancement which involved as conditions
what seemed to him to be a sacrifice of personal independence
or of honestly held opinions. In fact, excepting
in this matter of subsidies from patrons, Erasmus
may fairly claim to have shown in his career, under very
great pressure from various quarters, a clear-headed, well-balanced
and courageous independence of opinion and
of action that was most exceptional at a time when theological
partisanship was bitter to the point of ferocity. It
is also to be borne in mind that when, through the satisfactory
management of his literary undertakings on the
part, first of Aldus, and later and most importantly, of his
good friend Froben, Erasmus began to secure from his
writings an assured income, the disagreeable subsidy suggestions
disappear from his correspondence, although he
is still very ready to accept <i>honoraria</i> from appreciative
friends. It is certainly not a little to the credit of both
Erasmus and his publisher, that there is no single instance
in the long correspondence of an application to Froben
for moneys, either as “advances” or as loans, or a single
complaint about inadequacy of payments. In fact, as
specified later, Erasmus criticises Froben for undue liberality
to himself.</p>

<p>The first journey to Italy would probably not have
been undertaken (or at least not at that time) if it had
not been for the friendly help of the Lady of Vere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
Froude doubtless, however, sacrifices (and not for the
first time) accuracy of statement to dramatic antithesis
when he writes: “Without Mæcenas we might have had
no <i>Odes</i> or <i>Satires</i> from Horace; without the Duke of
Lerma we should have had no <i>Don Quixote</i>; without the
Duke of Weimar we might have had no <i>Faust</i>; without
the Lady of Vere there would have been no <i>New Testament</i>,
no <i>Moriæ</i>, no <i>Colloquies</i>.” This is a kind of <i>reductio
ad absurdum</i>, an attempt to make the production of men
of creative power depend upon, instead of being merely
furthered by, the help of their patrons. But Froude probably
does not mean to be taken seriously. He goes on to
say: “The patronage system may not be the best, but it is
better than leaving genius to be smothered or debased
by misery, and when genius is taught that life depends
on pleasing the readers at the shilling book-stalls, it may
be smothered that way too, for all that I can see to the
contrary.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It is not easy to understand to what book-stall
influences Froude refers, although we can recall certain
strictures of Freeman to the effect that Froude
himself attempted to debase history to the level of the
readers of “shilling shockers.”</p>

<p>The Paris edition of the <i>Adagia</i> is not the work in the
form in which it is now known. When Erasmus, in 1507,
took up his abode for a time with Aldus in Venice, he re-wrote
and greatly enlarged the book to such an extent as
almost entirely to change its character. He tells us that for
a large proportion of the new material he was indebted to
the suggestions and to the magnificent library of Aldus.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
He had, he goes on to say, brought with him to Venice little
more than a confused mass of materials derived from authors
already in print. Aldus and his associates, Laskaris,
Marcus Musurus, Aleander, and some even whose names
were not known to Erasmus, placed at his disposal many
valuable manuscripts which had not before come into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>print. The number of proverbs collected now amounted
to thirty-five hundred, and a vast mass of learning, drawn
from the most varied sources, was thus given to the world.
Erasmus writes with candid appreciation of the generous
encouragement given to a foreigner, in this and his other
literary undertakings, by the Italian publisher and his
associates.</p>

<p>The motto used by Aldus under his famous emblem of
the dolphin and the anchor, <i>festina lente</i>, was borrowed
from a coin by the Emperor Vespasian, with whom as
well as with Augustus, this saying was a great favourite.
Erasmus writes in 1508: “If some deity friendly to literature
will but favour the truly royal vows of Aldus, I can
promise that within a few years the studious will possess,
by his work alone, all the good authors there are in the
four languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldee, in a
complete and accurate form, and no one need have any
lack of literary material. And then we shall see how
many excellent manuscripts there are still hidden, which
are either kept back through ignorance, or which are suppressed,
owing to the ambition of certain persons who
care for nothing except that they may be thought the
only wise men. Then, too, we shall know with what prodigious
errors existing texts abound which are now considered
tolerably correct.... The library of Ptolemy,”
he adds, “was contained within the walls of a house, but
Aldus is constructing a library which shall have no limits
but those of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>In the same volume of his correspondence, Erasmus
speaks of himself as having surpassed Hercules, who was
unable to grapple with two monsters at once, whereas he
has not only brought out at the same time the great edition
of <i>S. Jerome</i> and the enlarged edition of the <i>Adagia</i>,
but in so doing has overcome the greatest enemy of the
works of man, Time, which is devouring its own offspring.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
In its expanded and final form, the <i>Adagia</i> fills
one of the eleven folio volumes which constitute the set
of the works of Erasmus. Drummond speaks of it as “a
monument of vast learning ... and a rich repository
of anecdotes, quotations, and historical and biographical
sketches.... It formed an introduction to the Greek
and Latin classics, and it furnished eloquent declamations
against kings and monks, war and priestcraft. It served
the purpose of a dictionary and a grammar, a common-place
book, a journal, and a book of travels all in one.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Froude says that “through the <i>Adagia</i> can be traced the
spirit of Lucian, so like was the Europe of the fifteenth
century to the Europe of the second.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The divines
were outspoken in their indignation. They said (again
to quote Froude) that the Proverbs of Solomon were
enough, without adding the Proverbs of Erasmus. The
revised edition of the <i>Adagia</i> was reprinted by Froben in
1513, from the text of Aldus, in an edition rivalling that
of Aldus in the beauty of its typography. The two publishers
appear to have made a friendly arrangement with
each other and with Erasmus to divide between them the
market for the writings of their famous friend.</p>

<p>The <i>Praise of Folly</i> (<i>Encomium Moriæ</i>), the book which
exceeded the <i>Adagia</i> in its final popularity, and which is
possibly the only work of Erasmus that continues to be
read, three centuries after his death, was written in 1509.
Erasmus was at the time again in England, living in the
family of his friend, Sir Thomas More. He mentions in
the preface that the plan of the work had taken shape in
his mind as he was riding across the Alps on his way from
Venice to London, and that it had then occurred to him
how odd it was that the wisest and wittiest man he knew
should have a name which in Greek signified a fool. In
another letter, Erasmus gives a somewhat different account,
saying that the first suggestion of the book came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>from More, and that it was, in part at least, based upon
More’s conversations with him at Chelsea.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> I find record
of an edition of this book, which is probably the first,
printed in Strasburg in 1511 (three years earlier than the
issue in Basel) by a printer named Schürer. The text
was revised and added to before the printing in Basel and
in Paris. It does not appear what relations, if any, the
author had with the printer Schürer, whose name was
not again associated with his writings.</p>

<p>The Froben edition, printed in Basel in 1514, included
a commentary by Gerard Listrius, a physician of Basel
and a trusted friend of Erasmus. The book was reprinted
several times by Froben, one of the editions containing
the famous illustrations by Holbein. Authorised
editions were also published by Aldus in Venice, and by
Badius in Paris, while unauthorised issues of the Latin
original appeared in Cologne, Lyons, Salamanca, and
elsewhere. A number of translations appeared in different
parts of Europe, the majority of which were probably
unauthorised, although on this point trustworthy information
does not exist. In its various forms it possibly
secured a larger sale than any book, except the Bible, that
had as yet been printed. Erasmus was able to write that
kings, bishops, archbishops, and cardinals were delighted
with it, and Leo X. read it through from beginning to
end.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Drummond sums up the volume as “containing in
a short compass the author’s whole philosophy of man,
all that he ever wrote on the abuses of his times, on the
superstitions of monks and the pride of kings;...
abounding in wit and eloquence and displaying great
knowledge of the world and keen observation of men and
things, it has its deep and serious meanings beneath the
light satire.” One result of the publication of the <i>Praise
of Folly</i> was the prohibition of the writings of Erasmus
in many of the universities, including Paris, Louvain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Oxford, and Cambridge, where the ecclesiastical influence
controlled. “See what comes of Greek,” cried the clergy.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Drummond assigns as an important reason for the departure
of Erasmus from England in 1514, the fact that
the Press of England was at the time too far behind the
Press of the Continent to permit of the satisfactory
printing of important works. The reputation of the
scholarly work done by Froben, and the news that he was
at work on an edition of <i>S. Jerome</i>, had reached England,
and were the means of directing Erasmus to Basel and of
bringing about an association that proved of no little importance
for both author and publisher. It was on the
journey that he met Sebastian Brandt, author of one of
the famous works of the century, <i>The Ship of Fools</i>, Wimpfelingus,
Listrius, who wrote a commentary on the <i>Praise
of Folly</i>, and Beatus Rhenanus, who became a life-long
friend.</p>

<p>On arriving at Basel, Erasmus plunged at once into the
work of Froben’s publishing office. During his first year
in Basel, in addition to revising his <i>Encomium Moriæ</i>, and
preparing for the press successive editions of the <i>Adagia</i>
and the <i>De Copia</i> (Book of Similes), he gave arduous
labour to the <i>S. Jerome</i>, the investment in which he shared
with Froben, and to another great undertaking, a complete
edition of the works of Seneca. He also began a
series of translations from Plutarch, and, a little later, undertook
the editorial work on the Froben edition of the
New Testament. In 1515, while on a third visit to
England, Erasmus wrote his treatise on the <i>Education of a
Christian Prince</i> (<i>Institutio Principis Christiani</i>), which
was printed by Froben in the year following. The prince
on whose behalf the essay had been prepared, and to
whom it was dedicated, was Charles of Austria, the Arch-duke
of Burgundy, then a lad of fifteen, who was afterwards
known to history as the Emperor Charles V. 
 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> 
 Erasmus had visited Brussels in 1513, and, while there,
had been appointed a Councillor to the young prince.
The treatise is spoken of by biographers as sound in
counsel and wholesome in tone, but as possessing no
very distinctive importance, and Erasmus himself speaks
slightingly of it. The essay written by Erasmus for the
guidance of the future emperor will naturally be compared
with the more famous treatise of Machiavelli, <i>The Prince</i>,
which was composed at about the same time, probably in
1516. <i>The Prince</i> was prepared for the private use of
Lorenzo de’ Medici, and was not designed for publication.
It was put into print in Florence about 1520, and despite
the harsh criticisms that have been brought upon it for
what in modern times would be termed its “Machiavellian”
morality, it is to-day, nearly four centuries after its publication,
considered as belonging to the world’s literature.</p>

<p>In 1515, Erasmus took time from his literary work to
interest himself in behalf of his friend, the learned and
high-minded Reuchlin, the greatest Hebrew scholar of
the age. Reuchlin had fallen under the persecution of
the Dominicans, led by the ignorant and bigoted Hochstraten,
for his opposition to the diabolical proposal to
destroy all existing Hebrew literature, the Scriptures
alone excepted. He had defended himself in a book
entitled <i>The Eyeglass</i> (<i>Speculum Oculare</i>), and on a mandate
being issued by Hochstraten to burn this, Reuchlin
had appealed from the Inquisition to the Pope.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The
Bishop of Speyer, to whom Leo committed the case, gave
judgment in favour of Reuchlin, and imposed on his enemies
perpetual silence, a sentence which proved difficult
of execution. Reuchlin was condemned by the Universities
of Mayence, Erfurt, Louvain, and Paris, although
there were at the time professorships of Hebrew both in
Louvain and in Paris. The matter, in some fashion,
was again brought before the Pope. Erasmus made an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>earnest and eloquent appeal to the Pope on behalf of his
friend, and the support of the Emperor Maximilian was
also secured for the aged scholar who had done so much
to bring honour upon the cause of learning in Germany
and in Europe. The Pope finally confirmed the previous
decision in favour of Reuchlin, a decision which rescued
from the status of heresy, in which it had been placed by
the Dominicans and the learned Faculties of the universities
above specified, the language of the Hebrew Scriptures
and the literature of the chosen people of God.
Reuchlin’s books were rescued from the ban and their
learned author was saved from the risk of the stake. He
continued to teach Hebrew in Tübingen and in Ingolstadt,
and published in 1520, in Stuttgart, the first Hebrew
Dictionary issued in Germany. In the appeal made
to the Pope by Erasmus, he is shrewd enough to emphasise
the importance of the collaboration rendered by
Reuchlin in the preparation of the <i>S. Jerome</i>, a work
which had been fitly spoken of as an enormous service
rendered to the Church, and which the Pope himself had
specially commended.</p>

<p>The edition of the New Testament, edited by Erasmus
at the instance of Froben, was based in part upon the
previous labours of Laurentius Valla, to whom must be
given the honour of having been the first to attempt a
revision of the text by a comparison of authorities. In
fact, some time before beginning work on his New Testament,
Erasmus had edited for Froben a volume containing
the annotations of Valla. In April, 1515, Beatus
Rhenanus writes to Erasmus from Basel: “Froben wants
you to place in his hands your proposed edition of the
New Testament, and promises that he will give for your
work as much as anybody.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> A sentence so worded,
written by one literary man to another, has quite a
modern sound, giving the impression that several publishers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>were prepared at this time to bid against each
other for the editorial service of the first scholar of Europe.
As a fact, however, such a work as was projected
could at this time have been undertaken in but three or
four places, while only two or three publishers possessed
the knowledge, the enterprise, or the plant requisite for
its production. The New Testament with the Erasmian
notes might have been printed in Paris, as far as the facilities
for Greek type were concerned, but the influence
of the Theological Faculty of the Sorbonne was entirely
unfavourable to the presentation to the public of any
critical or analytical work on the Scriptures, and it was
very difficult, if not impracticable, for a university publisher
to handle successfully a work in the department of
theology, of which the Sorbonne disapproved. Koberger
of Nuremberg had publishing facilities adequate for such
an undertaking, but Koberger appears to have associated
himself with the more conservative group of Catholic
scholars, and to this group the Testament of Erasmus,
with its critical notes, seemed to be a very dangerous
innovation.</p>

<p>The result showed that there was ground for their
misgivings, as the Testament of Erasmus was to prove
of most vital service to the cause of the Reformation,
although the learned editor himself was at the time
regarded with suspicion, if not with enmity, by the larger
number of Protestant leaders. There remained the Press
of Aldus; the Venetian would unquestionably have been
very ready to take charge of the book, and his Press possessed
at the time larger facilities for the printing of
Greek than could be offered by Froben, or than existed
outside of Venice. Erasmus appears, however, to have
decided that for the purposes of this work Basel was a
better centre of distribution than Venice, and it was
doubtless the case that a much larger circle of readers
could be looked for in Switzerland, Germany, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
regions to be conveniently reached from Basel, than was
to be found in the market more immediately at the command
of Venice.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the very large investment of skilled
labour and of money that the New Testament called for,
the publication proved a financial success. A second
edition was required within three years, making a total
printing, up to 1519, of 3300 folio copies. In this second
edition the text was largely altered and the volume was
fortified with a papal brief, a copy of the Nicene creed,
and an engraving of the Trinity, which ought, as Drummond
remarks, to have proved effectual in protecting <span class ="err" title="original: the the">the</span>
work against charges of heresy. Above the letter of
the Pope is printed a quaint device, a woodcut representing
the victorious Germans under Arminius overthrowing
the legions of Varus, and accompanied by an inscription,
<i>Tandem, vipera, Sibillare desiste</i>. The insertion of this
German device with its motto was probably the work of
the printer. The purport of it could hardly be considered
as complimentary to an Italian Pope. Froude, in commenting
upon the great popular interest in the book, says
that 100,000 copies were speedily sold in France alone,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
but I can find no evidence in the records of the printing
of any such number, and I think that Froude must have
been misled by some general reference to its wide distribution.</p>

<p>There is not space here to consider the long series of
controversies provoked by the publication of the Testament
of Erasmus, a volume which undoubtedly contained
the first text approximating to correctness that Europe
had as yet known. As before stated, the text was utilised
by Luther as the basis of his own all-important German
version, although in the bitterness of the disappointment
on the part of the Lutherans that they had not secured
the adherence of the great scholar, they appear never to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>have made any very specific acknowledgment of the
enormous service rendered to the cause of the Reformation,
as well by his scholarship as by his courage. On the
side of the Church, the murmurings were many and soon
became bitter. Accusations were heard of heresy and
Arianism. Erasmus had departed from the version of
the Vulgate, and had substituted comparatively pure
Latin for the monastic barbarisms, and he had even, it
was said, charged the Apostles with writing bad Greek.
He had had the temerity to correct a number of texts in
such a way as materially to alter their meaning, and he
had omitted altogether the testimony of the “Three
Witnesses” in the first Epistle of John. This unfortunate
verse, after being accepted by the Protestants on
the strength of its retention by Luther, and of the later
and more scholarly authority of the editors of the King
James version, was finally condemned as an interpolation
by the revisers under Victoria, who were thus in a position,
after an interval of three and a half centuries, to
bear testimony to the accurate scholarship and the editorial
boldness of Erasmus. It is to be regretted, on the
ground of the consistency of Erasmus, that he was induced,
in a later edition, to restore this text (I John,
v. 7).</p>

<p>That Erasmus did possess the courage of his convictions
was evidenced by the character of the notes
appended to the volume. I have space for but a single
instance. In commenting upon the famous text, Matt.
xvi. 18, “Upon this rock will I build my church,” he
takes occasion to deny altogether the primacy of Peter,
and to express his surprise that words undoubtedly meant
to apply to all Christians should have been interpreted as
applying exclusively to the Roman Pontiff; and this is
said, it should be remembered, in a volume dedicated to
the Pope.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>
<p>In 1524, Erasmus completed his <i>Paraphrase of the New
Testament</i>, which was also printed by Froben. Drummond
speaks of this book as of no great intrinsic importance,
but says further, that no other of his productions
gave such universal satisfaction, or so entirely escaped
criticism. An English version was printed in London
under the authority of the author, and the work was so
highly appreciated in England that a copy was ordered to
be placed in every parish church beside the Bible.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>It had been the hope of Erasmus that the reformation
of the Church, the necessity for which he so fully recognised,
was to be brought about by the advancement of
sound learning and the diffusion of the Scriptures. By this
means, as he believed, the superstitions of the monks and
their followers would be dissipated, the corruptions of the
Church would be purged, and the unity of christendom
be preserved. To the production of literature planned
to further this great purpose, Erasmus had devoted a lifetime
of arduous and scholarly toil, and to his books he
added the influence of an enormous and far-reaching correspondence.
It was also to the initiation and inspiration
of Erasmus that must be credited not a few of the
great undertakings of his earnest friend Froben, “the
publisher of high ideals,” undertakings which, with hardly
an exception, had for their purpose the enlightenment
and development of a perplexed world. The final work
of the Reformation was to be done under other leaders
than Erasmus, and the results were to be brought about
by other means than the publication of correct texts,
scholarly commentaries, or even of satires upon monkish
abuses. But the wit, learning, and intellectual force of
Erasmus, brought to bear, in part through his correspondence,
and in part through the Presses of Froben, Badius,
and Aldus, exerted a wider influence and played a much
greater part in the long contest against the rule of monkish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>superstition than was understood at the time, or than
has, in fact, been fully recognised until a comparatively
recent period.</p>

<p>In 1519, Erasmus completed for Froben an edition of
<i>Cyprian</i>, planned as a companion to the <i>Jerome</i>, and an
edition of Cicero’s <i>Offices</i>, a book which, as before mentioned,
the list of no scholarly publisher could be without.
In 1518, Froben published for his friend the <i>Familiar Colloquies</i>,
which became, next to the <i>Praise of Folly</i>, the
best known work of Erasmus, and which is accepted by
his biographers, as expressing, perhaps more directly and
comprehensively than any other of his writings, his personal
opinions, prejudices, feelings, and preferences.
Drummond says of it: “The established fame of the
author, the intrinsic merits of the work itself, its adaptation
to the times, the pungent epigrams which glittered
on every page, and, perhaps not least, the suspicions of
heresy which began to be whispered round, all contributed
to secure for it an immense circulation.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Froude
writes: “The <i>Colloquies</i> are pictures of his own mind,
pictures of men and things which show the hand of an
artist in the highest sense, never spiteful, never malicious,
always delightful and amusing, and finished photographs
of the world in which the author lived and moved.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The
book was translated into nearly every European tongue.
The authorised editions were many and profitable, and
the unauthorised, still more numerous. One printer in
Paris took advantage of a report that the University was
about to condemn the work, to print no less than twenty-four
thousand copies.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> From this edition the author appears
to have derived no advantage. He bears patiently
enough the financial injury caused by the unauthorised
issues, but becomes justly indignant when a Dominican
friar publishes an “expurgated edition” from which are
eliminated or “corrected” the passages bearing hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>upon the monks, of which there were not a few. The
work was finally condemned by the Sorbonne, and it had
the honour, somewhat later, of being placed by the
Inquisition in the first class of prohibited books.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>In 1523, Erasmus published through Froben the first
complete edition of the writings of S. Hilary, a work
which, owing to the great corruption of the manuscript,
cost him, as he tells us, enormous labour, and which was
also for the publisher a very costly undertaking. The
account books of Froben have, unfortunately, not been
preserved, but it is probable from the references in his
correspondence, that the <i>Hilary</i>, undertaken at the instance
of Erasmus, brought upon him a loss. This was
followed in the same year by an enlarged edition of his
<i>Method of True Theology</i>, in which Erasmus draws a
laboured comparison between the pains of authors and
those of mothers, remarking that some of the former are
like bears, which bring forth mere lumps of flesh and
then are compelled to lick their cubs into shape.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>In 1524, Erasmus published his famous treatise on
<i>Free Will</i>, in which he defined clearly his relations to the
Lutheran movement. In so far as this movement represented
a protest and revolt against the many abuses that
had crept into the Church, Erasmus had found himself in
cordial sympathy with it, and, in fact, by no one had
these abuses been set forth more graphically and more
boldly than by himself. His criticism of the corruption
and the evils of the Romanists had been so keen and so
unsparing that the Protestants could not understand why
he did not join hands with their leaders and break altogether
with Rome. Erasmus was prevented from taking
this course by two considerations: he did believe in a
Church Universal, and he did not believe in the Lutheran
doctrines. Condemned as a heretic by many of the
Roman ecclesiastics, he was stamped by the Protestants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>as a coward and a time-server. To the student of to-day,
it would appear that the course taken by him was the result
of honest and consistent conviction, and gave evidence of a
higher and more discriminating courage than would have
been evidenced by an acceptance of the cardinal’s hat that
was waiting for him in Rome, or of the leadership in a
popular cause which was proffered from Wittenberg. The
treatise on <i>Free Will</i> was the statement of Erasmus of the
grounds on which he was unable to accept the conclusions
of Luther.</p>

<p>In 1526, the Dean and Faculty of the Theological
School of Paris came together to consider the erroneous,
scandalous, and impious propositions contained in the
book by Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam, called <i>Familiar
Colloquies</i>, and decided that the reading of the same should
be prohibited. The prime mover in this censure was the
Chancellor Bedier, who was for many years the persistent
opponent of the liberal-minded publisher, Robert
Estienne. The writings of Erasmus had secured a considerable
circulation in Spain, the editions which were sold
there being at the outset supplied from Basel and from
Paris. Later, unauthorised issues of the Latin version
were printed in Salamanca, and the <i>Enchiridion</i> and the
<i>Colloquies</i> were both printed also in Spanish translations.
The Dominicans and Franciscans attacked furiously both
the books and their author, but the authority of the
Archbishop of Seville, directed probably by the favourable
influence of the Emperor, was sufficient for a quarter
of a century to prevent the books from being formally
condemned. Their titles finally appear in the <i>Index</i> of
the Inquisition in 1550 (see the chapter on Plantin).</p>

<p>In 1527, there came to Erasmus a great loss in the
death of his trusted friend Froben. “I bore with calmness
the death of my brother,” writes Erasmus, “but I
cannot endure the loss of Froben. He was a true friend,
so simple and sincere, that even if he had wished to conceal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
anything, it was so repugnant to his nature that he
would have found it impossible, so ready to do good to
all that he was glad to confer a favour even where it was
not desired, which made him an easy prey to thieves and
impostors.... To me his kindness was unbounded.
What plots would he not lay, what occasions would he not
seek, to force some present, upon me! nor did I ever see
him better pleased than when he had prevailed upon me,
either by artifice or by entreaties, to accept one ...
nor did I ever find more use for my rhetoric than to invent
pretexts for declining the munificence of my publisher
without giving umbrage to my friend: for I could not
bear to see him disappointed.... He paid bills for
me before I suspected it, nor could he be prevailed upon
by any entreaties to take back the money ... and
this kind of contest went on between us continually ...
but I am sure all his family will bear witness
that I availed myself of his kindness very moderately.
Whatever labours I undertook for him I undertook for
the love of learning. Considering that he gave up his
whole life to the advancement of such labours, avoiding
no fatigue by day or night, but esteeming it a sufficient
gain if a good author came into the hands of the public
with due dignity, how could I prey upon a man thus
minded? Sometimes, when he showed to me and to
other friends the first pages of some great author, how he
danced for joy, how his face beamed with triumph!
You would have thought he was already reaping in the
greatest abundance the fruits of his labours and expected
no other reward.... Within these few years, how
many volumes, and in what noble type, have issued from
Froben’s office.... He has refrained from having
anything to do with controversial tracts, from which no
small profits have been made by others, lest he should
bring useful learning into disrepute.... He was bent
on printing <i>Augustine</i> to equal the splendour of the <i>Jerome</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
notwithstanding the discouragements of myself and other
friends, and he was wont to say that he desired no longer
life than would suffice to finish <i>Augustine</i>, of which he saw
the completion of the first and second volumes only. It
was a pious wish, and the spirit by which he was animated
was deserving of immortality.... He leaves wife,
children, friends, the whole city, all who knew him or his
work, bitterly to lament his loss.... Gratitude
demands that we give our hearty support to the printing-office
of Froben, which is to be continued, so that what
he has so well begun may ever improve and develop.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
This letter is certainly most honourable both to the writer
and to the man whose faithful work is thus commemorated,
and the friendship between the two men forms an
interesting and characteristic episode in the long history
of the relations of publishers and authors.</p>

<p>The later productions from the pen of Erasmus may
be briefly noted: A treatise on the Confessional, which
appeared in 1524, and which, with characteristic boldness,
contains a scathing exposure of the evils of the
institution; an exposition of the Lord’s Prayer, printed
at about the same date; a series of devotional addresses
and brief commentaries, in 1524 and 1525; a treatise on
the use and abuse of the tongue, in 1525; the <i>Institution
of Christian Matrimony</i>, in 1526; the <i>Christian Widow</i>,
in 1527, written in compliment to Maria, sister of Charles
V., whose husband, the King of Bohemia, had been killed
shortly before; an edition of <i>Irenæus</i>, in 1526 (<i>Irenæus</i>
had not before been printed, and the work of Erasmus
had, therefore, to be done from manuscripts); an edition
of <i>Ambrose</i>, in four volumes, in 1527; an essay on the
correct pronunciation of Latin and Greek, in 1528; an
edition of <i>Seneca</i> (of whom he speaks as a pagan saint), in
1529; the concluding volumes of the great <i>S. Augustine</i>,
in the same year; the works of S. Chrysostom, in 1530
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>(this contains a Latin translation and a memoir); the
<i>Apopthegms of the Ancients</i>, in eight books, in 1531; the
works of S. Basil, in 1532; and, finally, <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, a
treatise on the preacher, in 1534. This was the last book
completed by the busy scholar, but his correspondence
continued active until his death, which occurred in July,
1536. A number of the larger works mentioned in the
above brief summary, such as the <i>S. Augustine</i> and the
<i>S. Chrysostom</i>, were prepared for the press with the co-operation
of others, but even these represented very considerable
labour on the part of the responsible editor, and
it is not easy to understand how, dyspeptic invalid that
he was, he was able to find the time and the strength for
such continuous and such arduous labour. Nearly all of
the books of the last nine years were printed in the Froben
Press, which was being successfully carried on by
Jerome Froben, the eldest son of its founder, with the
aid of his friend Boniface Amerbach. Erasmus had, in
1529, on the ground of the increasing bitterness of the
Protestant feeling in Basel, given up with no little regret
his home in that city, and had removed to Friburg. His
intercourse with the Frobens continued unbroken, however,
and Jerome Froben was with him at the time of his
death.</p>

<p>I have given a fuller reference to the literary undertakings
of Erasmus than might seem to be warranted by the
general purpose and proportion of my narrative. I had,
however, thought it desirable to present with some detail
the record of the publishing relations of some representative
author of the time, and the career of Erasmus
rendered him, on a number of grounds, the most distinctive
author for my purpose. His commanding position
and world-wide celebrity as a scholar, his relations with
men of note and of learning in Protestant as well as Catholic
circles, the wide circulation secured for his writings, a
circulation absolutely without precedent in the history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the world’s literature, and, finally, his close association
with the most famous publishers of their time, two of
whom, Aldus and Froben, must take rank with the most
famous publishers of any time—all these considerations
unite to make the experience of Erasmus, as an author,
one of exceptional interest in the history of publishing
undertakings. To the above summary must be added
the important detail that Erasmus was the first author,
after the invention of printing, to secure a large and continued
return from the sales of his writings. From the
time of Gutenberg on, payments had been made by publishers
to the scholarly editors whose services were utilised
in preparing for the press the editions of the classics
and the Fathers, to whose works the earlier publishing
undertakings were with rare exceptions restricted. There
is record also of the publication before the close of the
fifteenth century and early in the sixteenth, chiefly in
Paris, of occasional volumes of original writings. Few of
these, however, were addressed to what we should call
the general public, and before the time of Erasmus there
is no record of an author’s making money by the sale of
original productions. While the correspondence and
diaries of Erasmus have been preserved, I find no mention
of any accounts, and, in fact, he was not the kind of
a man who would have been likely to trouble himself with
such details as account-books. Unfortunately, the records
of Froben’s business have disappeared, and we have no
means of ascertaining the precise amounts paid to Erasmus
by his publishers, either for his editorial services or
for royalties on his books. Drummond is, however, of
opinion that these receipts were very considerable. Erasmus
spent from year to year considerable sums in journeys,
in books and manuscripts, and in other ways,
although during the years of his sojourn in the house of
Froben, his actual living expenses must have been moderate.
He had no property, the small inheritance from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
his father having been dissipated by his guardians. In
addition to the income from his books, he had, after 1507,
a pension of sixty pounds settled on him by Warham,
Archbishop of Canterbury; there was, for a time at least,
a pension from Lord Mountjoy; and a pension of some
smaller amount (I have not been able to find the exact
figures) from the Emperor Charles V. after 1523. Froude
estimates his income from pensions in 1529 at four hundred
florins.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> He also received from time to time various
presents of money from his wealthy English friends, such
as Colet, More, Warham, and the Lady of Vere, and from
Popes Leo X., Adrian VI., and Clement VII. According
to Froude, he had no capacity for taking care of money,
and however much he received, he was always in need.
In his earlier years he found occasion, in fact, to write not
a few applications for money, in a style of appeal which
strikes the reader of to-day as entirely unbefitting for a
man of his character, education, and intellectual distinction.
It was, indeed, not until his association with
Froben had made clear to him that his writings possessed
commercial value, that he was able to shake off the feeling
of dependence upon the purses of patrons. With his
earlier books, his first thought appears to have been to
utilise the appreciation of them by his friends as a means
of securing gifts. After Froben had shown him that by
proper management the books could be made to secure
from the appreciation of the public at large good returns
for the author, the letters of Erasmus became free from
the repeated suggestions concerning gifts and financial aid
which formed a disagreeable feature of much of the earlier
correspondence.</p>

<p>It was not the least of the important services rendered by
Froben that he was able to further the development of a
spirit of independence on the part of the greatest author
of his time, and to rescue him from the demoralising influences
of literary patronage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="center">LUTHER AS AN AUTHOR—1483-1546.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">IN the long list of the noteworthy men of the sixteenth
century, the men who helped to shape the history not
only of their own generation, but of long series of
generations to come, a leading place, possibly the leading
place, must be assigned to Martin Luther.</p>

<p>The story of the bold-hearted Augustinian monk, who,
strong in his convictions of the justice of his cause, and
strong in his faith that the Lord would protect his own,
ventured to assail the abuses and, finally, even to question
the authority of the Church of Rome, the only
Church then known to Europe, and who dared, standing
almost alone, to withstand the mandates of pope and of
emperor—this story, forming one of the great dramas of
history, has been often told. For the purposes of the
present narrative, however, I am not concerned with
Luther as a Reformer, as a fighter, or as a Christian hero,
but simply with his work and his relations as an author.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, in selecting two authors as examples
of the literary activities and of the publishing methods of
the first part of the sixteenth century, that one of these
two should be Luther, whose writings achieved a larger
popularity and exercised a more far-reaching influence
than could be claimed for any books of the century. It
is to be borne in mind, however, that Luther’s work as an
author was not something apart from his interests as a
Reformer. He wrote because he felt the spirit of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Lord to be upon him, and because he had the conviction
that he was God’s instrument for bringing a message
to the world, and for delivering the true Church
from the burdens and corruptions that had been brought
upon it through the wiles of Satan.</p>

<p>The Reformation was an intellectual revolution, and the
immediate work of the Reformers was carried on by argument,
presented in part by preaching, but very largely by
means of printed material, books and pamphlets. It is
difficult to conceive of the accomplishment of the Reformation
without the aid of the printing-press, and it is
probably, in fact, not too much to say that, without the
printing-press, the work done by the Reformers could not
have been brought about at all. The Church authorities
had, as we have seen, given to the first printers a cordial
welcome, and many of the earlier typographers had been
indebted to ecclesiastics for all important co-operation
and support. After, however, the printers of Wittenberg
had begun to send out by thousands the pamphlets of
Luther and Melanchthon, and when, a little later, the
presses of Geneva and Zurich were being devoted to supplying
to a public still nearer to Rome the writings of
Calvin and Zwingli; when, in fact, Europe seemed to be
full of “winged words,” words the sting of which was
nearly always directed against Rome, the ecclesiastics
began to realise the extent of their blunder. Repression
in various forms was attempted: rigorous censorship, prohibition,
confiscation and burning of copies, the <i>Index
Expurgatorius</i>, the ban of excommunication on writers
and printers of forbidden books—all these and other forms
of restriction were put into force, with the very general
result of advertising the objectionable literature, of emphasising
its importance, and of adding to its circulation
and its influence. The Church finally took the printing-press
into its own service, and it succeeded, in the course
of a generation or two, in training up a school of literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
defenders and apologists who, in the period of the
Catholic revival, were able, in a measure at least, to hold
their own in controversy with the Protestant opponents
of Rome. It was certainly the case, however, that, taking
the sixteenth century as a whole, the printing press proved
one of the most effective of the influences for undermining
the authority of the Papacy and for restricting
the rule of the Roman Church.</p>

<p>Luther had been prompt to recognise the value for his
work of the new art. He was equally keen in his appreciation
of the fact that if the fight against Rome was to
secure a popular support, it was necessary to reach with
the teachings of the Reformers not only the limited circles
of the educated, but the masses of the people. It was
for this purpose that Luther, first among the leaders of
the Reformation, put forth his sermons, tracts, and controversial
pamphlets at once in the language of the people,
and he completed his great appeal to the understanding
and the moral sense of his fellow countrymen with the
stupendous and magnificent achievement of the German
Bible. For thousands of Germans, the first practical
knowledge of the existence of the possibilities of the
printing-press came to them with the sight of the sheets
of the Wittenberg pamphlets or of the volumes of the
Wittenberg Testament.</p>

<p>It would doubtless have seemed to Luther a small thing
in his life’s work that, while carrying on his great fight
against Rome, he was also laying the foundation of the
book-trade of Germany and of Europe, but this was a
matter of no little moment, if only for the lasting influence
of the Reformation itself. The historians of the time are
certainly in substantial accord in the conclusion that the
enormous impetus given to the education and active-mindedness
of the people through the distribution and
the eager acceptance of the writings of the Reformers,
the habits then formed of buying and of reading printed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
matter, the incentive secured for the work of the printers
and the booksellers, and the practice that came into vogue
of circulating books and pamphlets by means of pedlars
and colporteurs in districts far beyond the reach of the
book-shops, had both an immediate and an abiding effect
upon the reading habits of the German people and did
much to bring about the development of the publishing
and bookselling business in Germany.</p>

<p>Luther’s life covered the sixty-three years between 1483
and 1546. At the time of his birth, the printing-press
had been in operation for a third of a century. When, in
1517, he printed, in Wittenberg, his first book (a collection
of sermons on the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s
Prayer), the production of printed books was still an unfamiliar
art. The principal German centres of the new
publishing trade were Basel, Frankfort, Augsburg, and
Nuremberg. In the North of Germany, much less had
been done, although, for some years, there had been
presses in Cologne, and a beginning had been made in
Leipzig. It was the Reformation and the superior intellectual
activity of the Protestants that transferred the
literary and publishing preponderance from South to
North Germany, a preponderance that through the succeeding
centuries has continued and has increased.</p>

<p>The list of Luther’s works is not a long one, and is
made up in great part of pamphlets. His chief writings
may be briefly summarised as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1516. “Sermons on the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1517. “Commentary on the Seven Penitential Psalms.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">The title-page of this volume reads: <i>F. Martinus Luder Augustiner
zŭ Wittenberg</i>. (The Seven Penitential Psalms was one of the two devotional
publications of Colard Mansion, the first printer of Bruges, whose
edition was issued in 1471.)</li>

<li class="ifrst">1517. “A Sermon on Indulgences and Grace.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">The immediate incentive to this sermon was the sale of Indulgences by
Tetzel.</li>
<li class="ifrst"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
1518. “Conclusions.” The title given to the famous ninety-five theses.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1518. “Lectures on the Epistle to the Galatians.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1520. “Address to the Christian Nobility of Germany.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">The title-page bears no date and no imprint. Below the name of the
author appears simply “Zu Wittenberg.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1520. A treatise entitled “Why the Books of the Pope and his Disciples
were burnt by Dr. Martin Luther.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">This was published shortly after the burning by Martin Luther, in
Wittenberg, of the papal decretals, the name given by Köstlin to the
papal law-books, and a collection of the writings of Eck and other papal
advocates.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1521 (The year of the Diet of Worms). A series of controversial
pamphlets in reply to Emser.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1521. An “Exposition of the Gospel” and a Commentary on the
“Magnificat.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1521. Tracts on “The Abuse of Masses,” and “On Monastic Vows.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1522 (September). The complete German version of “The New
Testament.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">The first edition comprised 5000 copies.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1522 (December). A second edition of 5000 copies.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1527. Various treatises in reply to the teachings of Zwingli and Œcolampadius.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The four years following 1522 appear to have been chiefly devoted,
as far as literary production was concerned, to the revision of “The
New Testament” and to work on the version of the books of “The Old
Testament.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1528. Various treatises or tracts on “Confession,” the “Lord’s Supper,”
“Anabaptism,” the war against the Turks, a commentary on the first
twenty-five Psalms, and a version of thirteen of the “Fables of Æsop.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1530 (The year of the Diet of Augsburg). A series of tracts on “The
Keys of the Church,” “The Forgiveness of Sins,” and “The Sacrament,”
“The Duty of Keeping Children at School,” and a commentary on the
118th Psalm.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1531. The German version of the Psalms.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1531. Gloss on the supposed “Edict” of the Emperor, and a “Warning
to his Beloved Germans.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1532. “Exposition of Genesis.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1537. A treatise on German Names.</li>

<li class="ifrst">This was issued at Wittenberg, anonymously, but, according to Köstlin,
was unquestionably the work of Luther.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1539. A treatise on Councils and Churches.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1539. A tract against the practice of usury.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1541. A treatise on Biblical Chronology.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1541. The completed German version of the Bible.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Revised issues of this were printed in 1543 and in 1545.</li>
<li class="ifrst"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
1543. “The Summer Postills,” with a series of sermons on the
Epistles.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1545. A pamphlet entitled “The Popedom at Rome Instituted by the
Devil.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1545. Cranach’s Caricatures against Popedom, with brief verses on texts
by Luther.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1545. A revised edition of his collected Latin writings.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above were printed at Wittenberg.</p>

<p>The greater number of the pamphlets were issued at
once in two editions, one Latin and one German.</p>

<p>One of the more important of the earlier <span class ="err" title="original: pamplets">pamphlets</span> or
<i>Flugschriften</i> of Luther was the <i>Address to the Nobles of
Germany</i>, which was printed in August, 1520, and of which
five thousand copies were sold in five days. Of the pamphlet
containing his controversial address against Eck, printed
in 1518, fourteen hundred copies were sold in two days at
the Frankfort Fair. The popular interest excited by the
writings of Luther and his associates brought about a
great change in the trade of the book-shops. Editions of
the Fathers and of the lives of the Saints were pushed to
one side from the counters or the book-shelves, or were
stored away in the warehouses, and even the classics were
neglected. All the demand was for the writings of the
Reformers. The replies of the defenders of the Church
found for some years a comparatively slow sale, as the
sympathies of the larger book-publishing centres and of
the public reached by them were largely with the Protestants.
Some few of the leading publishers, including
the two most important in Germany, Froben of Basel
and Koberger of Nuremberg, remained, however, in the
orthodox fold, and Froben, possibly at the instance of
Erasmus, gave up printing the writings of Luther.</p>

<p>Luther’s first publisher was Johann Weissenburger from
Nuremberg, who had, in 1513, established himself in
Landshut in Bavaria. In Landshut he printed, in 1517,
a tract by Luther entitled <i>Tractatus de his qui ad Ecclesias<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Confugiunt</i>. Later in the same year, the treatise on the
Seven Penitential Psalms was printed by Joh. Grunenberg
in Wittenberg, also in Latin. This was, however, immediately
followed by a version in German, of which in five
years no less than nine editions appeared. The ninety-five
theses, copies of which, on the 31st of October, 1517,
Luther had nailed on the doors of the Wittenberg castle
church, were printed in that town, in the same year, in
Latin, under the title <i>Disputatio pio Declaratione Virtutis
Indulgentiarum</i>. This first edition was followed by three
others printed in Wittenberg, and one in Nuremberg. A
year later appeared, also in Wittenberg, the first edition
in German, which, in the course of the next two years,
was followed by twenty-two other editions. These were
printed in Wittenberg, Leipzig, Nuremberg, Augsburg,
Basel, and Breslau. It does not seem practicable to
ascertain, either from the publishing records or from the
references in the various biographies, how far these editions
were authorised or how far they represented simply
the enterprise of piratical printers. What is made quite
clear in the various utterances of Luther himself, is the
fact that his only desire was to secure for the theses the
widest possible circulation. He made no criticism of the
action of any of the printers who put into the market editions
of this or of his other writings, excepting when such
editions, not having had the benefit of the author’s supervision,
were printed in incorrect or incomplete form.</p>

<p>The <i>Sermo de Digna Preparatione Cordis</i> was published
in 1518, and the German version followed a few months
later. Of the original were printed during the next two
years eight editions in Wittenberg, Leipzig, and Augsburg,
while of the translation, during the same period, were
issued no less than thirteen editions. Of the tract entitled
<i>Die Deutsche Theologie</i>, printed at once in Latin and in
German in 1518, appeared during the succeeding four
years from seventy-five to eighty separate editions. The
bibliographers are in doubt as to the precise number.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span></p>
<p>Of the sermon or tract upon the <i>Sale of Indulgences</i>,
Kapp records ten authorised editions in the two years
succeeding 1518, and three editions issued respectively in
Leipzig, Nuremberg, and Augsburg, which are specifically
described as unauthorised. The next of the series of
tracts of this year, <i>Decem Precepta Wittenbergensi Predicata
Popula</i>, was printed in the Latin form in five editions, and
in the German version in seven. Among the latter are
included three unauthorised issues, again dating from
Leipzig, Augsburg, and Basel. There was also a Bohemian
edition issued in Prague in 1520. It is not surprising
that printers like Petri, working at so distant a
point as Basel, should have felt free, with “missionary”
material of this kind for which there was an immediate
popular demand, to put forth editions without reference
to the author. It is somewhat surprising, however, that
unauthorised editions should also have been issued in
Leipzig, but a few miles from Wittenberg, as with the
leading publishers of Leipzig Luther and his Wittenberg
associates had maintained satisfactory relations. Other
tracts of this period, the most of which were printed
in the same publishing centres, and the editions of which,
both Latin and German, were promptly absorbed by the
public, were the <i>Resolutiones Disputationum de Indulgentiarum
Virtute</i>, the German version of the hundred and
tenth <i>Psalm</i>, and the <i>Sermo de Virtute Excommunicationis</i>.</p>

<p>The complete Lutheran version of <i>The New Testament</i>,
published in 1522, constituted not only, as the historians
of the time make clear, a central fact of first importance
in the work of the Reformation, but the most noteworthy
of the literary productions of its author. The work is of
necessity classed as a translation, but it was a translation
into which had been absorbed, in very large measure, the
individuality and original thought of the writer. The
production of this German Bible was an essential part of
the work of the Protestant Reformers. The teaching
that Christian believers must base their relations with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
their Creator upon the inspired Word required that this
Word should be placed within reach of all Christians and
should be in a form to be understood by the unlettered as
well as by the scholarly.</p>

<p>In addition to the great work done by Luther for the
world at large, he rendered to Germany the essential service
of initiating (or, as some German historians say, of
creating) high German literature. The half century’s
work of the printing-press had thus far been devoted
almost exclusively to the production of books for scholars,
printed in Latin, the universal language of scholarship, or,
in a few instances, in Greek. The Brothers of Common
Life in Holland, and a small number of other printers in
North Germany, had printed for the use of the people
books of a popular character in low German, <i>platt-deutsch</i>.
It was Luther who recognised the better possibilities of
development and for literary expression existing in the
division of the language known as high German, the form
that (with the changes of three centuries) has since been
known as German. In selecting this tongue for his own
writings, and, what was of more abiding importance, for
his version of the Bible, Luther made of it the foundation
of modern German literature. He did not, in fact, find a
vehicle ready-made and fully fitted for his purpose, but
through his own wealth of imagination and study and
incisive speech, he contributed not a little to secure for
this new language of literature strength and flexibility
for forcible and varied expression. The printed books in
German before the appearance of the first tracts of
Luther, formed but an inconsiderable group, and were
restricted practically to chap-books and almanacs, and to
popular medicine or herb-lore, a few folk-songs and tales,
and some editions of lives of the Saints, printed principally
by the Brothers of Common Life.</p>

<p>The labour and natural philological capacity required
for such a task as producing a German version of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
Bible at a time when no such thing as a German dictionary
existed, and when there was, in fact, no accepted
standard for literary expression in the German tongue,
must have been very considerable. It was peculiarly fortunate
that this capacity was, in Luther, united with the
strenuousness of purpose and persistent industry which
rendered the work possible at all. The final work of his
translation was completed in the Castle of the Wartburg,
during his sojourn there as a voluntary prisoner in charge
of his valiant defender, Ulrich von Hutten, after his
return from the Diet of Worms.</p>

<p>The piratical reprinters took prompt advantage of the
popular interest in the work. The “enterprising” Petri
of Basel was the earliest in the field, getting his first
reprint into the market before the close of the year (1522)
in which the original had appeared. During the succeeding
three years, Petri printed in all seven editions, four in
octavo and three in folio. His neighbour and rival, Wolf,
printed during the same time five editions, and Schönsperger
of Augsburg followed with three. I do not find
record of the number of copies comprised in these several
editions, but they must have aggregated a good many
thousands. In estimating the cost of their production, it
is to be borne in mind that the process of taking casts or
<i>clichés</i> of the type was an invention of a much later
period, and it was, therefore, necessary with each fresh
impression to reset the type.</p>

<p>In 1520, a Bull of Leo X. excommunicated Luther,
condemned his works individually and collectively, ordered
existing copies to be burnt, and prohibited, under
severe penalties, the printing, sale, distribution, or even
possession of any of his writings. The immediate effect
of this Bull was to cause a largely increased sale throughout
nearly all parts of Germany for everything that
Luther had written, and to bring about also a very considerable
demand for them from other countries. Köstlin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
estimates that by 1520, more than one hundred editions
had been printed of the German versions of Luther’s sermons
and tracts. This estimate includes, of course, all
the unauthorised issues, as well as the editions printed at
Luther’s Wittenberg Press. The distribution of these
pamphlets was effected only in part through the regular
book-trade. Thousands of copies were sold in the market-places
by dealers of all kinds, many of whom had never
before handled books; and large supplies were distributed
among readers out of reach of the book-shops and the
market-places, by travelling pedlars and by colporteurs.
Many of the latter were travelling students, who were
working not for gain, but in the cause of the Reform.
These popular tracts of the excommunicated heretic appear
to have met the needs of all classes, educated and
uneducated, and secured a wider circulation than had
heretofore been achieved by any religious works, or, for
that matter, by any writings whatever.</p>

<p>During the earlier years of his work, while this work
was directed rather against the abuses that had grown up
in the Church than against the authority of the Church
itself, and before the Reformers had attempted any constructive
theology, Luther was able to preserve relations
with the leaders of the Humanistic movement, and received
encouraging letters from men like Erasmus and
Reuchlin, who stood at the head of the liberal scholarship
of the time. It was only later, when the Church had
cast out Luther and the Lutherans had definitely repudiated
the authority of the Church, and when the doctrines
of the Lutheran creed had been finally formulated,
that Erasmus, who had heartily sympathised with the
fight against the abuses of ecclesiasticism, but who believed
that the Church Universal should be preserved,
and who did not believe in the doctrine of justification
by faith, cast in his lot with the opponents of Luther, a
decision that was marked by the publication of his famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
essay on <i>Free Will</i>. The Reformers took pains, however,
to utilise for their cause, as far as practicable, the
influence and the learning of the Humanists.</p>

<p>In 1520, Ulrich von Hutten published a translation of
the treatise of Laurentius Valla, one of the earliest of the
Italian Humanists, which had been first issued in Naples
in 1450, and in which was exposed the forgery of the
<i>Donation</i> of Constantine. The <i>Donation</i> was the document
or edict in which Constantine was supposed to have
granted to the Roman See the possession and control of
the entire western world, making the Church the heir of
the Roman Empire. The scholarly argument of Valla
had never been refuted, and its republication at this time
dealt a heavy blow to the traditional pretensions of the
Papacy; but this purpose did not prevent von Hutten
from dedicating his translation to Leo X.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of the revised edition of
<i>The New Testament</i>, the indefatigable Luther entered
upon the still more laborious task of translating the books
of <i>The Old Testament</i>, the work upon which continued for
a number of years. He secured the help of a group of
scholarly collaborators, of whom the most important was
Melanchthon. For <i>The New Testament</i> he had had the
use of the Greek edition edited by Erasmus, and recently
published by Froben of Basel, a volume which, as well for
the accuracy of its text as for the scholarly authority, the
boldness and the original information of its notes, far surpassed
any texts of the Scriptures as yet issued. Luther
expresses very freely his obligations to the learning and
industry of Erasmus, and never got over his astonishment
that a man who had the scholarship and the courage to
puncture so many of the unwarranted assumptions of the
Roman Church, could still believe that Church to be
worth preserving.</p>

<p>The Catholic theologian Cochläus, a violent opponent,
says: “Luther’s <i>New Testament</i> was multiplied by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
printers in a most wonderful degree, so that even shoe-makers
and women and every lay person acquainted with
the German type, read it greedily as the fountain of all
truth, and by repeatedly reading it impressed it on their
memory. By this means they acquired in a few months
so much knowledge that they ventured to dispute not
only with Catholic laymen, but even with masters and
doctors of theology, about faith and the gospel.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Luther’s young friend, Mathesius, thus describes one
of the meetings of Luther and his collaborators on the
work of the German Bible: “Dr. Luther came to them
with his old Latin Bible, his Hebrew texts, and the portions
of his German translation. Philip (Melanchthon)
brought the Greek text, and Dr. Kreuziger (Cruciger),
besides the Hebrew, the Chaldaic Bible (the translations
or paraphrase in use among the ancient Jews); the other
professors had with them their ‘Rabbis’ (<i>i. e.</i> the Rabbinical
writings of the Old Testament). Each one had
previously armed himself with a knowledge of the text
and had compared the Greek and Latin with the Jewish
version. The president then pronounced a text and let
the opinions go round. Speeches of wondrous truth and
beauty are said to have been made at these sittings.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The most important of the publishers who issued unauthorised
editions of Luther’s writings was, as stated,
Adam Petri, of Basel. During the ten years between
1520 and 1530, he made a special business of the issue of
these reprints, and according to Kapp, he derived from
them large profits. I find no record of any complaints
from Luther directed specifically against Petri. His
principal annoyance about reprints had been in connection
with inaccurate and incomplete texts, but the Petri
Press had a good repute for the excellence of its typography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span></p>

<p>In Augsburg, where had appeared some of the earliest
issues of the Bible, Hans Schönsperger printed, in 1523,
an (unauthorised) edition of Luther’s <i>New Testament</i>,
with woodcuts by Schäuflein. In 1524, a complete series
of Luther’s writings was printed by Sylvan Othmar. It
is not clear whether or not this edition received the sanction
of the author. Siegmund Grimm, of Augsburg,
acted as the principal publisher of the writings of Hutten.
Hase tells us, in his history of the great Koberger publishing
house of Nuremberg, that during the ten years
succeeding 1517, the sales of the works of theology
(orthodox Catholic) of which the Kobergers made a
special interest were very seriously lessened through the
influence of Luther and of Luther’s writings.</p>

<p>During the years 1520-1523, Magdeburg became a
centre for the production and distribution of Protestant
polemical literature, and a great number of controversial
pamphlets were issued there. Through the influence of
Luther, these were for the most part first printed in high
German, but towards the latter portion of the period,
many of the briefer and less scholastic tracts were issued
also in low German in order to reach the lower classes and
readers of the Northwest. After the death of the liberal-minded
and tolerant Archbishop Ernst, and with the
accession of the bigoted Albert of Brandenburg (who was
also Archbishop of Mayence), the publishing activities
of the city were seriously hampered. The Roman side
of the controversy was then taken up in Magdeburg by
Dr. Mensing, the Court preacher, and by Dr. Cyclops.
Tübingen, however, became for a time the centre for the
controversial publications of the Romanists, and it was
there that appeared, between 1519-1522, the works
and pamphlets of Luther’s opponents, Eck, Cochläus,
Dietenberger, Neudorffer, and others.</p>

<p>The presses of Tübingen were, however, also utilised
for the cause of the Reformers. In 1529, Primus Truber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
and Ulrich Morhart issued (under an assumed imprint) a
Slovenic or Slovakian version of Luther’s Catechism. The
same men printed the first Slovenic primer and dictionary,
and were thus instrumental in fixing a printed form for
Slovenic literature. In 1530, they printed an edition in
Bohemian of Luther’s <i>New Testament</i>, a work that should
have rejoiced the spirit of John Huss, dead one hundred
and nine years earlier. The work of these enterprising
printers was of no little importance in furthering the
spread of Lutheran doctrines among the Slovaks of
Moravia, Bohemia, and Hungary. In 1557, the Freiherr
of Ungnad, an earnest Protestant, placed funds at the
disposition of Truber for the printing of editions of
Luther’s writings in the Croatian tongue.</p>

<p>In 1518, Luther brought to Wittenberg from Leipzig
Melchior Lotter, who was an experienced printer and a
man of good training and scholarship. Lotter brought
with him a good equipment of presses, type, and moulds,
and also a valuable collection of collated texts. In 1519,
Luther is able to write with satisfaction to Lange, the
Augustinian Vicar in Erfurt: “Lotter has completed the
organisation here in Wittenberg of a well-appointed
printing-office, fitted for work in three languages.” The
languages were probably Latin, Greek, and German, but,
a little later, Hebrew fonts must also have been added.
Lotter did not give up his business in Leipzig, but after
the completion of the organisation of the Wittenberg
establishment he placed in charge of it his two sons, and
arranged to pass the greater portion of his time in Leipzig.
I do not find any record of the arrangement entered into
by Luther with Lotter. It seems probable that the
printer, who was a man of established business and with
resources, entered upon the undertaking in Wittenberg as
a venture of his own, on the strength of the assurance
from Luther that he could depend upon securing the
printing commissions of Luther and his associates and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
such further material as might come from the University.
Luther had paid Grunenberg for the printing of the earlier
volumes, and he probably also retained in his own hands
the ownership of the editions manufactured by Lotter.
Unfortunately, the accounts of these editions appear not
to have been preserved. In 1531, Rhaw printed the
Augsburg Confession, his edition of which was accepted
as the standard. He printed also many of the writings
of Melanchthon. Hans Lufft, whose work continued from
1523 to 1584, printed after 1524 many of the publications
of Luther. His special achievement was the production
of the German Bible in the several parts and in the completed
volume.</p>

<p>The printing and publishing interests of Wittenberg,
which had their beginning under the direction of Luther,
in the University, continued during a large part of the
existence of the University to be associated with and
directed by it.</p>

<p>The first issue of Luther’s Bible in low German was
printed in Lübeck, in 1533, by Ludwig Dietz, of Rostock.
In Jena, Conrad König was agent for the sale of Luther’s
works. The price per volume for the Bible was eighteen
groschens for Jena, at the Leipzig Fair nineteen groschens,
and at the Frankfort Fair twenty groschens.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>These earlier printers were fortunate in securing in their
offices the services, as revisers and correctors, of learned
men who had a scholarly interest in the work. Melanchthon
served as editor, reviser, and press-corrector in 1514-15
with Thomas Anshelm in Tübingen. Professor Johann
Hiltebrand, of the University of Tübingen, Melanchthon’s
predecessor in Anshelm’s office, named himself with pride
<i>Castigator Chalcographiæ Anselmitanæ</i>. He had supervised
the printing of several Latin and Greek grammars,
and also of the <i>Epistolæ Virorum Clarorum</i>, published as
a rejoinder to the famous <i>Epistolæ Virorum Obscurorum</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>Pellican (Conrad) supervised for Petri of Basel the printing
of the piracy edition of Luther’s Bible, receiving for
his service board during the months he was occupied.
The long association of Erasmus with Froben has been
already referred to. Rhenanus writes to Erasmus, May 10,
1517: “Lachner promises to secure due acknowledgment
to you for your services. In September you will receive
payment for the work of revising the text of <i>S. Augustine</i>.
He is now arranging the matter with Koberger in Frankfort.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Kapp is authority for the statement that Luther received
for his literary work no honorarium or compensation
other than occasional copies of the printed volumes.
This statement has reference doubtless only to those publications
of Luther’s (many of them wholly unauthorised)
which were issued by printer-publishers as ventures of
their own. It is probable, however, as before stated, that
the Wittenberg editions of the miscellaneous writings,
and that of the German Bible, were printed at Luther’s
risk and expense, and it is fair to assume that for the
sale of these editions, which were his property, the receipts
(less some selling commission) were paid over to
Luther. The sale of Luther’s writings (both books and
pamphlets) certainly exceeded anything that had as yet
been known in the book-markets of Germany or of the
world, and from the Wittenberg editions alone there must
have been some proceeds. The first editions of Luther’s
smaller and larger catechisms were printed in 1529 by
George Rhaw, who had established himself as a printer
in Wittenberg in 1521. He was distinguished as a musician
and a mathematician, and, later, became magistrate
of the town.</p>

<p>After the publication of the Edict of Worms, Duke
George of Saxony took ground against the Reformers
and forbade the printing and the distribution of their literature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>The authority of the Duke was sufficient to put a
stop to the larger portion of the printing that had been
carried on in Leipzig for the Reform writers, but Wittenberg
was outside of the Duke’s domain, and the Elector
Ernest and his successor Frederick, were both friendly to
the Lutheran cause. As a result of the restrictions in
Leipzig, a number of the exiled printers made their way
to Wittenberg, and the presses of Wittenberg became
busier than ever. The printing of the German New Testament,
begun in April, 1522, was completed on the 22d
of September of the same year, the first edition comprising
five thousand copies. By the end of July, Luther
reports that three presses were at work upon the book.
This first edition was printed in folio, and with the simple
title, <i>Das Neue Testament, Deutsch, Vuittenberg</i>. Neither
the translator nor the printer is specified, and the title-page
bears no date. The volume was published at one
and a half guilders, the equivalent of twenty-five marks of
to-day, or $6.25. The edition was exhausted within three
months after publication. The German edition of the
Old Testament appeared in divisions; the Pentateuch
was issued in January, 1523, and by the end of 1524 had
been published all but the Books of the Prophets. There
was then a long gap in the publication, the work being
finally brought to completion in 1534, in which year
appeared the first edition of the entire Scriptures in one
volume.</p>

<p>In 1524, the artist, Lucas Cranach, an old friend of
Luther, instituted, in company with a goldsmith named
Döring, a new printing-office, to which was afterwards
confided a large proportion of the work of Luther. Cranach
appears to have been a man of varied activities.
The portraits from his brush that have been preserved
give evidence of continuous work in his studio during
this period, while in addition to the printing-office above
referred to, he carried on a paper-warehouse and a book-shop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
His several portraits of Luther are the chief
authority for the Reformer’s personal appearance. In
1534, the Cranach-Döring printing establishment was
transferred to three new partners, Goltz, Schramm, and
Vogel, who had secured from the Elector Johann Friedrich
a privilege covering the complete Bible. They
purchased the woodcuts that had been prepared from
Cranach’s designs for the Apocalypse, and they appear to
have continued to utilise the co-operation of Melchior
Lotter (the younger).</p>

<p>Kapp records that during the lifetime of the Reformer,
not less than 100,000 copies of Luther’s New Testament
were printed in Wittenberg. It would be much more
difficult, and probably impracticable, to arrive at any
trustworthy estimate of the aggregate of the various
unauthorised editions issued in Germany. The circulation
of both the authorised and unauthorised editions
was very much furthered, outside of the regular channels
of the book-trade, by the work of the pedlars and the
travelling preachers.</p>

<p>As has before been indicated, it would not be in order
to judge by the standards of later times the “reprinting”
undertakings of the period of the Reformation. It was
not only the case that the larger number at least of these
reprinters felt no consciousness of wrong-doing or of the
infringement of any rights either of the author or of the
original publisher, but that, as far at least as the controversial
writings of the time were concerned, they believed
they were rendering a material service to the cause, and
were carrying out the wishes of the Reformers in securing
for these writings the widest possible circulation. The
German Bible, having been placed under the ban of the
Church, must be classed with the controversial writings
referred to, and it was, of course, the most influential
publication of the series in extending the doctrines of
the Reformation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span></p>

<p>At the time of the death of Luther, there appear to
have been no privileges in force covering his version of
the Bible, although claims to its ownership were asserted
by Hans Lufft. In 1500, Rühel and Sulfisch of Wittenberg
secured a privilege for printing the Bible, but this
evidently did not convey any exclusive right, and should
therefore be regarded rather in the light of a permit.
Other editions soon appeared in Leipzig, which was the
best market for the sale of the Bible, and for the control
of this market various contests arose. The restrictions
upon the Leipzig publishers in regard to the printing of
the Luther versions were gradually removed, but it was
not until 1564, and chiefly at the instance of the Duke
of Weimar, that this version became common property
(<i>literärisches Gemeingut</i>) for all Germany, and was formally
declared free of privilege.</p>

<p>Well pleased as Luther and his associates certainly
were in being able, either through their own publishers or
through the reprinters, to reach so many thousand readers,
they were not a little troubled at the inaccuracy and
incompleteness of much of the material sold over their
names. In September, 1525, Luther writes to inquire
whether his printers have not been heedless in permitting
thieves or burglars to make away with “copy” or sheets
for use in unauthorised printing elsewhere. “It is bad
enough,” he says, “for these rascals to get the advantage,
through theft, of my labour and pains, but with that I
would be patient, if it were not for the shamelessly false
and blundering form in which they issue books described
as mine.... In looking at one of these appropriated
volumes, I find here a big gap, there something entirely
transposed, here a sentence falsified, and, again, an entire
paragraph left without corrections. It seems to me an
abominable thing that we should labour while others
secure the results of our toil, leaving for us only annoyance
and shame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span></p>

<p>Luther closes his complaint, however, not with any
contention for the complete control of his material, but
with the very moderate suggestion that the reprinters
ought, if only as a matter of Christian feeling (<i>aus Christlicher
Liebe</i>), first to wait a few months in order to give
to the original edition a fair chance before interfering
with it, and, secondly, to print their own issues with a
decent regard for correctness and completeness.</p>

<p>In September, 1525, Luther writes to the magistrates
of Nuremberg, complaining that a large portion of the
proof-sheets of a volume of his sermons had been stolen
from his printing-office in Wittenberg, and had been
made use of in Nuremberg for the production of a piracy
volume. The publication of this volume in advance of
the issue of the complete work had caused his printers
serious injury. (<i>Wodurch seinen Drückern ein merklichen
Schaden zugefügt sei.</i>) He speaks here, it is to be noted,
as if the risk and ownership of this publication rested not
with himself, but with his printers. He goes on to say
in his letter to Nuremberg that he believes the printer
Herrgott had been concerned in this affair. He begs the
magistrates to use their influence with the local printers
to induce them to delay bringing out reprints of his writings
until seven or eight weeks after the publication of
the original editions; certainly a very moderate request.
He concludes, “If you can give me no help in this matter,
I shall be obliged to make an open publication to
warn the public against these thieves and robbers, but I
should be sorry to have to print in such a connection the
name of the city of Nuremberg.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The magistracy promised in reply to this appeal, that
an edict should be issued forbidding the reprinting, within
a specified time, of Luther’s writings. It appears, nevertheless,
that for some years at least no further action was
taken. In 1532, however, in response to a renewed appeal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>from Luther, an edict was issued, not forbidding the Nuremberg
printers to issue reprints, but simply forbidding
the use on publications printed in Nuremberg of the false
imprint of Wittenberg. This prohibition was, however,
simply a repetition of a provision of the imperial Act.
The Nuremberg edict also insisted upon greater care for
an accurate text (<i>besser correctür befleyssen</i>).</p>

<p>In a letter from Luther to Spengler, the Syndic of
Nuremberg, dated November 7, 1525, he refers to an
association that had been formed of certain leading
printers of the Rhine cities to repress or discourage
piracy (<i>diese Buberei</i> is the expression used by Luther),
and asks the Syndic to induce Koberger to give to the
association the aid of his all-important influence and co-operation.
It does not appear, however, that the Kobergers
interested themselves in the undertaking. Their
publications were almost exclusively works of a scholarly
character, issued (in Latin) in folio or in quarto, works
which did not tempt the German reprinters, whose appropriations
were chiefly devoted to volumes of a popular
character and to pamphlets, <i>Flugschriften</i>. Aggravating
as this very general practice of piratical reprinting was
to Luther and to such other authors of the time (a
group, however, at best but inconsiderable) who had
secured a popular hearing, and also to their authorised
publishers, it seems evident not only, as before pointed
out, that it furthered very largely the rapid spread of the
doctrines of the Reformation, but also that it helped to
build up the business of publishing and bookselling, and
to develop the habit among the masses of the people
of buying and of reading books, and of being influenced
by printed arguments.</p>

<p>During the first years of the sixteenth century, instructors
and students were much hampered by the scarcity of
text-books. When, in 1520, Reuchlin began his lectures
in Ingolstadt, he reports that there was in the town no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
single volume in Greek or Hebrew. He was obliged,
therefore, in his instruction work to write out texts in the
two languages on black-boards for the students to transcribe.
Basilius Amerbach, when he was a student in
Tübingen, speaks of hiring on certain hours in the week a
copy of the <i>Corpus Juris</i>. Trutwetter, the teacher of
Luther, had taken his own classical instruction from Publicus
Rufus, a Florentine who had brought to Erfurt,
shortly after 1500, the revived Italian enthusiasm for
classical studies. The University of Erfurt was one of
the oldest in Germany, dating from 1392.</p>

<p>Luther mentions, as if it were an exceptional instance,
that in 1506, when he was a student in Erfurt, he had
bought a copy of the <i>Corpus Juris</i> (the book from which
the lecturer was then giving instruction).<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> It was evidently
at this time not common for students to own
copies of the text-books in use. Thomas Plater relates in
his autobiography that in the school of S. Elizabeth at
Breslau, as late as 1515, there was usually but one text-book
for each class. The instructor or one of the students
would read this for dictation, and the students having
taken their notes would memorise them for recitation.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
When Melanchthon began, in 1524, his lectures on Demosthenes,
the only copy of the <i>Orations</i> in town was that
owned by the lecturer.</p>

<p>The chief representative of the intellectuality of the
Lutheran movement was doubtless Philip Melanchthon.
Of Melanchthon’s relations with the literary and publishing
activities of the time, the limits of this chapter will
not permit any full consideration. It is sufficient to say
that, apart from his service as a preacher, and as collaborator
on the German Bible, he devoted himself particularly
to the work of preparing text-books for higher grade
students, a work which earned for him the title of <i>Præceptor Germaniæ</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>He edited, and himself in part wrote a
series of text-books for use in the high schools and universities
on the subjects of Latin and Greek Grammar,
Rhetoric, Theology, Ethics, Physics, and Physiology.
These books displaced in the institutions of Protestant
Germany the works of Catholic writers, many of which
were survivals of the schoolmen, and were entirely antiquated
and inadequate. The contention maintained by
so many good Catholics, that no literature that had once
been sanctioned by the Church as good and sufficient,
could ever lose its value or authority, was of course especially
abused when applied to works of instruction. Under
the initiative chiefly of Melanchthon, Wittenberg became
the centre of instruction for the preachers and teachers of
all Lutheran Germany, while for a considerable period
Strasburg filled a similar place for the Calvinists of the
South-west.</p>

<p>While the immediate direction of this educational
work fell to Melanchthon, the inspiration for it, as for so
much of the intellectual activity of the Reformation, is
very largely to be credited to Luther, who had from an
early stage in the Reform work insisted upon the necessity
of defending the minds of the younger generation
from the influence of the educational traditions and
routine doctrinal teachings of the Church schools.</p>

<p>The work of the Lutheran educators would, of course,
have been impracticable if it had not been for the rapid
development of the publishing and book-selling trade of
the country, a development the chief incentive of which
is also due to Luther. “Now the printers will have their
hands full,” writes Hutten in 1517, to the Count of Neuenar,
when he hears of Luther’s declaration against the
operations of Tetzel. Hutten’s prophecy was fulfilled far
beyond his largest imaginings. The bold attack of Luther
was directed not merely at Tetzel and his fraudulent auction
sales of God’s forgiveness of sins, but at the corruption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
and demoralisation of the Church, a demoralisation
of which, as Luther recognised, Tetzel and his Indulgences
were but an inconsiderable symptom.</p>

<p>The downfall of imperial Rome, which (irrespective of
the internal causes) was brought about by persistent Teutonic
onslaughts, terminated the period of the world’s
history which is, for convenience, called classic or ancient.
In like manner, the overthrow of the world-wide domination
of ecclesiastical Rome was brought about by the
attack of the Teuton Luther, an attack which, backed up
by the Teutonic forces of North Europe, developed into
a revolution against Italian rule, and terminated the
epoch of mediævalism. For long periods to come, however,
the questions raised by Luther and his fellow Protestants
were to bring anxieties and conflicts upon popes,
emperors, princes, and people. These questions were
also to provide issues and themes for innumerable writers,
and to secure an apparently inexhaustible supply of material
for the printing-presses and the booksellers. It is
only with this last-named result that, for the purposes of
the present study, I am concerned.</p>

<p>According to the statistics of book-production collected
with painstaking thoroughness by Panzer, Weller, and
Kuczynski, and tabulated by Kapp, the total number of
separate works (principally pamphlets, <i>Flugschriften</i>)
printed in German in the year 1513 was 90; in 1518, 146;
in 1520, 571; and in 1523, 944. The aggregate for the
ten years is 3113. Of the total for the decade, no less
than 600 were printed in Wittenberg, a place which before
1517 had not possessed a printing-press<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>; this is an
indication of the immediate effect produced by the
Lutheran movement upon the work of the printers. The
revolution in publishing methods brought about in connection
with the Reformation was not restricted to the
introduction of German as a language for popular publications.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Of almost equal importance was the change in
the form and the price of books, the costly folios and
quartos being replaced by comparatively inexpensive
twelvemos and sixteenmos, and by far the larger proportion
of the writings which exercised the most immediate
influence on the thought of the time being issued in the
form of pamphlets. These pamphlets, sold in the market-places,
along the highways, and from house to house, by
pedlars working for gain, and by colporteurs having a
missionary purpose, took the place which in modern
times is filled by the magazine or weekly paper.</p>

<p>Luther recognised at once the importance of the printing-press
for the work he had in hand, but he was himself
amazed at the extent of the public that he was able to
reach when, after 1518, his tracts and sermons came to be
printed in German. Up to this time these had been
originally issued, according to the prevailing practice, in
Latin, and only in part translated into German. It is not
easy at this period to understand how the middle and
lower classes in Germany had been able, by the beginning
of the sixteenth century, to secure so general a proficiency
in reading as to be able to profit by the pamphlet literature
of the time, but, that a widespread elementary education
existed, is evident from the circulation secured
for these pamphlets, and from their immediate influence
upon opinion and belief. I can but think that the high
standard of popular intelligence which rendered possible
the comprehensive and general acceptance of the doctrines
of the Reformers, doctrines largely made known
through printed arguments, may very properly be taken
as a limitation upon the rather highly coloured descriptions
given by D’Aubigné and some other Protestant
historians of the extreme ignorance in which the masses
of the people had been left under the ministrations of
the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>The Edict of Worms of 1521, which committed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
Emperor Charles V. to the support of the contentions
of the Papacy, and threw the great weight of the Holy
Roman Empire against the cause of the Protestant Reformers,
marks also an important stage in the history
of publishing undertakings in Germany. It announced
the beginning of an imperial censorship, a censorship
which was confirmed and extended by the Edict of
Nuremberg of 1524. The first part of the edict may be
summarised as condemning Luther and all his works,
while the second, under the head of “regulation of printing”
(<i>Gesetz der Druckerey</i>), forbids the printing of all
writings that have not secured the explicit approval and
sanction of the ecclesiastical authorities. In the regions
under Lutheran influence, the only effect of the imperial
and ecclesiastical prohibition was, as noted, to increase
largely the circulation of the writings of the Reformers.
In the districts into which the Reform doctrines had only
begun to penetrate, the ecclesiastics were able in great
part, at least, to stop the further circulation of the pamphlets,
by taking prompt and harsh measures against the
colporteurs. From this time and until the close of the
Thirty Years’ War, Church and State worked together
(though not always in harmony) against the freedom of
the Press, on the broad ground that such freedom necessarily
resulted in heresy and in treason. The first imperial
Act in regard to libellous publications appears to
have been framed on the assumption that every writing
by a Protestant, even if entirely unconnected with theology
or with politics, must be libellous.</p>

<p>Charles V. had been willing to leave the responsibility
for the censorship of the Press in the hands of the
Church. During his reign, the printers were busying
themselves chiefly with controversial material, and in the
effects of this upon the minds of the people the State was
interested only indirectly. The Emperor Ferdinand was
a more faithful, that is to say, a more bigoted, son of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
Church than Charles, but he refused to admit that the
control of the Press was a Church matter. He took
the ground that censorship was a matter pertaining to
the State, that is, to the Crown, and that the Bishops
could take part in it only as delegates of the authority of
the State. This was the contention asserted and finally
secured by Francis I. and his successors in France.</p>

<p>In 1528, under the authority of the Emperor, Balthasar
Hubmayer, a preacher, printer, and travelling bookseller
of Nikolsburg, was burned in Vienna, together with his
wife and two apprentices, for spreading false doctrines.
Hubmayer had at first accepted the Lutheran views, but
had, later, associated himself with the Anabaptists. In
1529, the persecution of the printers and of the Protestants
in Austria was for the time relaxed because of the
peril of Vienna from the Turks, an exigency which absorbed
the full attention of the imperial authorities.
In 1564, was published in Rome an <i>Index librorum prohibitorum</i>,
the first of a long series.</p>

<p>The censorship was by no means left exclusively in the
hands of the imperial or of the ecclesiastical authorities.
With no little variation of policy both as to the theory or
standard of supervision and as to the methods of carrying
out the restrictions imposed, many of the States
established censorship of their own, and the same
course was taken by a number of the cities like Nuremberg,
Strasburg, Frankfort, and others, in which the
printing business had begun to assume importance, and
where the Church authorities had not already taken
charge of the function. In Nuremberg, one of the earliest
instances of the exercise of a city censorship occurred in
1527, in the case of a volume containing woodcuts illustrating
the history of the Tower of Babel, for which cuts
a rhyming text had been supplied by the cobbler-poet,
Hans Sachs. The book had been printed without a
licence or permission from the magistracy. The magistrates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
decided that the book must be suppressed. They
further cautioned Sachs that the writing of verses was not
his proper business, and that he should keep to his own
trade of shoemaking. <i>Nun seye solches seines Amtes nicht,
gebuhre ihm auch nicht.... Rathes ernster Befehl
dass er seines Schuhmachens warte, sich auch enthalte Büchlein
oder Reymen hinfür ausgehen zu lassen.</i> The edict
was simply an emphatic reiteration of the old proverb,
“Shoemaker, stick to your last,” or <i>Ne sutor supra crepidam</i>.
The difficulty appears in this case to have been
due not to the Lutheran tendencies of Sachs’s rhymes,
but to the lack of respect shown to the magistrates in
issuing a book without a permit; and to the further
breach of authority on the part of a man licensed only as
a shoemaker, undertaking also to carry on the avocation
of a poet. Sachs’s later history shows, however, that it
did not prove practicable to keep the poetic shoemaker
from writing and from printing his productions.</p>

<p>Luther was, it should be remembered, thoroughly in
accord with Pope and with Emperor in the belief that it
was the duty of the believers to stamp out heresy. He
only differed with them as to what constituted heresy.
In 1525, we find him invoking the aid of the censorship
regulations of Saxony and of Brandenburg for the purpose
of stamping out the “pernicious doctrines” of the
Anabaptists and of the followers of Zwingli. The Protestant
princes were, for the most part, more than willing
to establish and to maintain a censorship for the presses
of their several localities, as such a system served in more
ways than one to strengthen their authority, while it
could be utilised also to head off undesirable criticism.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the very general distribution secured
for Luther’s writings, may be cited a letter, dated February
14, 1519, written to the Reformer from Basel by
the publisher Froben, in which he speaks of large supplies
of the Basel editions being called for, not only in Germany,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
but in France, Spain, Italy, Brabant, and England.
The reference is to the first collection of Luther’s works,
of which impressions were printed in 1518, 1519, and
again in 1520.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Kapp is of opinion that from these sales
the author asked for and received no return either in the
form of royalty or honorarium. His purposes were accomplished
when his teachings, correctly printed, in editions
authorised and supervised by himself, and sold at the
lowest prices compatible with accurate typography, had
secured the widest possible circulation. While, therefore,
Luther serves as an example of a successful author, the
most successful, in fact, that the world had as yet seen,
his experience as an author did not help to advance the
recognition of the rights of an author in his literary productions.
To Luther, his writings were not property, to
be controlled for the benefit of the author, but great
truths and sound doctrine essential for the saving of
souls, and to be scattered widely for the benefit of the
reader. Köpflin, writing to Luther from Hagenau in 1519,
says, “We have printed your books one after another,
and within six months have disposed of all the copies.”</p>

<p>Luther himself writes to Cardinal Lang, in the same
year, that his books were being read by the theologians
of the Sorbonne. Johann Faber, Vicar-General in Constance,
writes in 1521 to Vadian, “Through the wrong-doing
of irresponsible printers, all kinds of unlettered
people have read or have had read to them the teachings
of Luther: even the old women in the streets stop to
chatter about them.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> It is to be remembered that the
effective circulation of Luther’s pamphlets (and of all the
popular publications of the time) was very much multiplied
by the practice on the part of those interested in
the doctrines, of reading such pamphlets out loud in the
market-places, to all who might be interested. After the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>

Lutheran writings had been put under interdict, such
public readings had to be discontinued in the towns and
districts which remained under Catholic control; but the
pamphlets were still widely (though surreptitiously) sold
by pedlars and colporteurs, and the readings continued
in places which were less liable to interruption than the
inns and market-places.</p>

<p>The jurist Scheurl writes from Nuremberg to Cardinal
Campeggi, March 15, 1524, “Every common man is now
asking for books or pamphlets, and more reading is being
done in a day than heretofore in a year.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> In Nuremberg,
as in other towns, it became the practice to read
the books of Luther out loud in the market-place. Erasmus
complains, in 1523, that since the publication of the
New Testament, the whole book-trade seems to be absorbed
with the writings of Luther, and to be interested
in giving attention to nothing else. He says that it is
very difficult to find publishers willing to place their imprint
upon works written in behalf of the papacy. In one
form or another, the German Testament and the other
writings of Luther were distributed with surprising rapidity
among all classes of people. As an example of the
kind of interest they excited, it is recorded that the magistrates
of Bremen sent a bookseller to Wittenberg for
the purpose of purchasing for their use a set of Luther’s
works. The citizens of Speyer are described as having
the books read to them at supper, and as making transcripts
of them. In hundreds of towns throughout Germany,
Luther’s writings were brought to the notice of
the people by means of the very edict which had for its
purpose their final suppression, and after the Diet of
Worms, the demand for them rapidly increased. The
preacher Matthäus Zell writes from Strasburg in 1523,
“The Lutheran books are for sale here in the market-place
immediately beneath the edicts of the Emperor and
of the Pope declaring them to be prohibited.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span></p>
<p>In the first half of the sixteenth century, means of
communication were very imperfect, and the delays and
difficulties of transportation of goods from one part of
the country to another (particularly on routes away from
the rivers) were very considerable. With no trustworthy
postal system, and with very restricted facilities for
remitting money, the hindrances in the way of ordering
books, of delivering them, and of collecting the amounts
due for them, must have been very great. In the absence
of journals, it could have been by no means an easy
matter even to make known to possible buyers the fact
that certain books had been published. The booksellers
depended for information concerning new publications
upon the semi-annual Fair which had been instituted at
Frankfort, but at this period it was only the more considerable
dealers who could afford to make regular visits
to the Fair, while it was also the case that a considerable
proportion of possible buyers were not within reach of
book-dealers of this class. There were, therefore, in this
initial stage of the book-trade, not a few inducements for
the production in various places, for supplying the demand
of the particular locality, of books of a popular
character, and this practice of producing unauthorised
reprints, while often causing grievances of one kind or
another, was hardly regarded as a misdemeanour, if carried
on with moderation and with some little regard for
the wishes of the author. The practice had also certain
specific advantages for the community, in ensuring
prompter supplies of books of present interest, and in
furthering the developing of local bookselling and of
general education. The material service rendered to the
cause of the Reformation by these earlier “book-pirates”
has already been touched upon.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of the widespread interest in the
writings of the Reformation, publishing business was
done in a number of out-of-the-way little towns which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
would to-day hardly support a printing-press. Lutheran
tracts were printed, for instance, in such places as Grimma,
Zwickau, and Eilenburg, principally for sale through
the pedlars. These issues were very frequently published
without imprint or date, and the tracing of the history of
their publication has, therefore, been difficult. The patience
of the German bibliographers is, however, inexhaustible,
and the lists of the presses of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries are probably now fairly complete.</p>

<p>Kapp says that the Petri edition of Luther’s <i>Testament</i>,
printed in Basel, could hardly have found its way as far
north as Saxony, and when, therefore, he finds record of
the sale of copies in Meissen in 1523, as low as fifteen
groschens, when the Wittenberg price was thirty groschens,
it is evident that piracy editions must have been
produced in the North as well as in the South. The
activity of Magdeburg as a centre for the production and
distribution of Protestant literature, has already been
referred to. After the death of Luther, the publishing
trade of Wittenberg, which had been the creation of his
personality, slackened, and Magdeburg became the headquarters
of the literary interests of the Reformers. The
trade in Bibles and hymn books, and in the collected
works of Luther was especially important, and continued
until the destruction of the city by Tilly in 1631.</p>

<p>The city of Münster was another place where Protestantism
had taken a strong hold, and large supplies of the
New Testament and of the Lutheran writings were distributed
from the presses of Münster throughout Westphalia
and the adjoining provinces on the north. The
excesses of the Anabaptists, who, under John of Leyden
and his associates, had possession of the town for a number
of months, 1535-36, were, however, wellnigh destructive
of its Protestantism, and proved fatal to its publishing
business. In the general havoc which obtained both
before and after the overthrow of the Anabaptists, books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
and printing-presses perished together. When the Catholic
Bishop resumed his sway, the production of the
Lutheran literature ceased, and there were but few Catholic
publications to take its place. The story of the brief
and dramatic rule of the Anabaptists in Münster was
utilised by Meyerbeer for his opera, <i>The Prophet</i>. In
1562, an edict issued by the Bishop ordered the destruction
of all Protestant books in Westphalia, and made it a
misdemeanour to print, sell, or possess any such books.
The sales continued notwithstanding, the supplies coming
mainly from Magdeburg.</p>

<p>In the Austrian dominions, the Church succeeded, in
1525, in inducing the Emperor Ferdinand to prohibit the
sale or the possession of Lutheran or Calvinist literature.
The book-pedlars succeeded for a time in evading the
prohibition and in distributing large supplies of the Testament
and of the tracts. The persistency of the Jesuits
was, however, in the end successful in crushing out the
business. Book-pedlars were treated as malefactors, the
peasantry and the townsfolk were frightened, and the
demand gradually died away. In other portions of Germany,
the circulation of the Protestant literature was, on
the whole, increased through the prohibitions. The
usual price for the Protestant tracts was one groschen,
equal to two and a half cents, or in purchasing power to
perhaps twelve cents to-day. Each tract reached, as a
rule, a number of readers or of hearers, for the old Oriental
and Greek practice of reading aloud to an audience
was carried on in hundreds of market-places, shops, and
other informal auditoriums.</p>

<p>One of the travelling printers and book-pedlars who
came to a tragical end was Johann Herrgott, who has
before been referred to as a reprinter in Nuremberg of
Luther’s writings, and who appears to have circulated
also a number of tracts considered by Luther to be extremely
heretical. He was executed, in 1527, in Leipzig,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
under the instructions of Duke George of Saxony. The
Duke was an old-time opponent of Luther, and he appears
to have taken the ground that freedom of speech
in any direction was objectionable. There was paid for
the burial of this too-persistent bookseller the sum of six
groschens.</p>

<p>The circulation of the Lutheran tracts was taken charge
of not only by the book-pedlars and colporteurs but by
a large number of travelling preachers, <i>Prädikanten</i>.
These “preachers” were, in part, old-time priests, but in
many cases laymen of very varying degrees of education
or of ignorance. The Wittenberg tracts gave, however,
a supply of ammunition which even the most ignorant
preachers could make effective. In reaching the masses
of the people, such tracts could be made more serviceable
than the rejoinders of the Catholic writers, as these last
were, with hardly an exception, written in Latin.</p>

<p>During the troublous times of the war of the peasants,
the progress of the Reformation was checked, and the
circulation of the Lutheran publications, in the districts
affected by the uprising, was for the time brought to a
close. As one of the historians expresses it, “The
bloody crushing out of the revolting peasants cut through
the vital nerve of the Lutheran movement towards the
creation of a national Church.... Luther showed,
however, the capacity to meet the crisis.... Fortunately
for the nation, he now possessed the influence
which enabled him to direct.... Repressing, on
the one hand, the tumultuous contentions of his followers
among the peasants, using his influence, on the other, to
temper the fierce indignation of the noble class, he was
in a position to do much to further the final settlement,
and was able, finally, to save from the ruin that had
seemed imminent the beginnings of the Lutheran
Church.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span></p>
<p>The active leadership of the Reform movement had
fallen upon Luther, who, while quite conscious of the
power of argument, of which he made full use, was by
nature a fighter, and whose very arguments, in their
forcible and trenchant and sometimes brutal character,
had the effect of verbal cudgels. One characteristic, in
fact, of the literature, or perhaps it is more accurate to
say of the controversial literature, of the sixteenth century,
was the tendency to coarseness of expression, and
the frequent use of libels and lampoons. When great
scholars like Erasmus and Reuchlin permitted themselves
to indulge in satirical invective, of which, judged by the
standard of to-day, the coarseness was often more apparent
than the wit, it is not surprising that fighters like
Luther and Hutten should be ready to indulge in verbal
onslaughts which seem more akin to brutal horse-play
than to reasonable argument. Luther’s last publication,
issued in 1545, was a series of theses written in reply to
a fresh condemnation pronounced against him by the
theologians of Louvain, in which series he included a
final paper against the Zwinglians. His death occurred
in 1546.</p>

<p>Enormous as was the circulation of Luther’s writings
at the time, and important and far-reaching as was their
influence, they have not taken a place in the world’s literature,
and but few of them would to-day find readers
except among special students of the period. It is to be
borne in mind, however, that while the writings of Luther
have not lived as books, the teachings and doctrines presented
in them have formed the basis of an enormous
mass of doctrinal and religious literature, and have continued
to direct, or at least to influence, the thought and
the faith of a very large division of the Christian world.
Luther as an author may be dead, but three hundred and
fifty years after his death, his thoughts and teachings are
still, through the books of his followers, reaching thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
of readers, and on both sides of the Atlantic his
spirit is still preaching in thousands of pulpits.</p>

<p>I have presented this summary of the published writings
of Luther simply as an example of the literary undertakings
and of the publishing methods of the time. What
has been said about the printing and the distribution of
the works of Luther could be repeated in regard to the
long series of productions of most of the other writers of
the Reformation, such as Melanchthon, Zwingli, Oecolampadius,
and also those of their opponents, Cochläus, Eck,
and the others.</p>

<p>It was doubtless an obstacle in the way of the development
of the conception of property in literary productions,
that during the first century of the printing-press,
so large a proportion of the publications which were the
work of contemporary writers, belonged to the class of
religious, doctrinal, and controversial literature. The
chief purpose of authors like Luther and Zwingli, was, as
we have seen, to secure the widest possible distribution
for their teachings. They believed that a right understanding
of certain doctrines was essential to salvation,
and they believed, further, that the responsibility had
been confided to them of bringing these doctrines to
humanity. It was not easy for authors holding such a
conviction to undertake to restrict or control the sale of
their writings for the purpose of securing profits for
themselves. There would, of course, under the existing
conditions, have been many difficulties in the way of carrying
out such control if it had been attempted. The fact
remains, however, that such attempts were but infrequent.
With this attitude on the part of the writers, and
of those who were earnestly interested with these writers
in establishing creeds and in influencing public opinion,
it is not surprising that the practice became general of
reprinting any material for which there was demand, or
for which it was believed that a demand could be created.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p>Such reprints were made in many cases by zealous
disciples, who multiplied and distributed copies for
“missionary” work, but outside of the believers, there
were naturally many others, printers and book-pedlars,
who were very ready to take advantage of a time of religious
fervour or of controversial interest, and to make
money by supplying the literature produced by the
Reformers or by their antagonists. The objections that
came from the authors were mainly on the ground of
inaccuracy in the printing of these unsupervised editions.
If the cause was to be furthered by the wholesale appropriation
and general distribution of their writings, they
were estopped from any serious opposition to the reprinters.
The habit thus became very generally established
on the part of the printers and the booksellers, of
regarding literary productions as <i>feræ naturæ</i>, in connection
with which no property right could be claimed.
The reading public, which, as far as the mass of the
people was concerned, came into existence only with
the application of the printing-press to the literature of
the Reformation, grew up, therefore, with the general
belief that nothing more was due to the author than to
read his teachings in any form in which they could be
obtained, and for these earlier readers any distinction
between an authorised and an unauthorised edition was,
for more reasons than one, an impossibility. While
Luther received moneys from the sale of the Wittenberg
editions of his books and possibly from a few others, it
is certainly the case that he made no money from these
sales. Every gulden that was paid for the books, every
pfennig that came in from the fly-leaves or pamphlets,
appears to have been at once expended in further printings
and in instituting further distributing machinery.
The same was the case with the other writers of the
Lutheran group and also with Zwingli and the Swiss
reformers generally. The books of Calvin formed to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
extent an exception. They were less available for popular
circulation, and, being addressed more particularly to
scholarly readers, were for the most part printed in
Latin. For them, the publishing arrangements were
more in accord with later methods, and the competition
of piracy editions was less serious. It is probable, therefore,
that they produced some returns for the author.
Some details concerning the Calvin publications are given
in the chapter on Robert Estienne. We may conclude
that while the Reformation was of important service in
furthering the work of the printers, in giving material for
the booksellers, and in inducing the habit of buying and
of reading printed matter, it probably helped to delay for
a number of years the formation of a correct conception
of literary productions as property. The one writer of
the time who was, however, able to do something to
establish such an understanding, and who succeeded also
in securing some substantial returns from the sale of his
works, was Erasmus. An account of the publishing
undertakings of Erasmus has been given in another
chapter.</p>

<p class="center">THE HOUSE OF PLANTIN.</p>

<p class="center">1555-1650.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">THE House established in Antwerp, in 1555, by
Christophe Plantin secured for itself high distinction
among the printer-publishers of the century,
and, as well for the beauty and importance of the productions
of its presses, as by reason of the exceptional length
of its history as a business concern, it must always hold
an honourable place in the record of the great publishers
of the world. Plantin’s work as a pioneer was, however,
not so difficult, so distinctive, or so important as that of
several of his great predecessors, such as Aldus, Badius,
Estienne, or Froben. At the time Plantin printed his
first book, in 1555, a century had elapsed since the Press
of Gutenberg had begun its work, and the technical difficulties
which had beset the earlier printers had been
very largely overcome; publishing machinery had been
created, and methods for the distribution of books had
been arrived at; while the scholars of the universities had
learned to utilise their attainments for editorial work, and
fairly trustworthy texts of the greater number of the
world’s classics were already available in printed form for
the use of the compositors in the preparation of later and
possibly improved editions.</p>

<p>Unlike many of his famous predecessors and contemporaries
among the publishers, Plantin laid no claim to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
erudition, and although he was a good linguist, he is not
to be classed with the scholars of his time. Nor would it
be fair to say of him that he was actuated in his work by
as high ideals as those which impelled men like Aldus
and Estienne. He had, like them, literary ambitions,
and a certain literary imagination, but the question of
direct profit filled a larger place and exercised a more continued
influence on his business policy and decision. In
religion and in politics Plantin was also evidently something
of a trimmer, and he was prepared from time to
time, if not to sacrifice convictions, yet to be very economical
in the assertion of convictions if reticence seemed
likely to further commercial advantage.</p>

<p>While Plantin belongs, therefore, both chronologically
and in personal prestige, rather to the second than to the
first grade of the earlier printer-publishers, he is to be
credited with the accomplishment of a great work, and a
work carried on in the face of many difficulties, including
wars, foreign and civil, the hampering censorship of the
Church, the bad faith of princes, his own over-optimism,
and the financial embarrassments resulting from these
and from other causes. As a result of his energy, creative
capacity, and persistency, he was able to overcome
these serious obstacles and to impart such vitality to his
concern as to secure for it a life of three centuries, the
longest continued existence ever enjoyed by any publishing
House. Its business, begun in 1555, came to a
close only in 1867, when the city of Antwerp bought the
printery in order to perpetuate its reputation through the
establishing of the Plantin Museum. The chief authority
on the life of Plantin and on the history of the publishing
undertakings of his House, is the beautiful memorial volume
by Max Rooses, published in Antwerp in 1883.
The full title is given in the Bibliography. To this work
I am chiefly indebted for the materials for the present
chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span></p>

<p>Christophe Plantin was born in 1514, in a village near
Tours. He died in Antwerp in 1589, continuing to the
last year of his long life to be active in his business
affairs. He appears to have had what to-day would be
called a good school education; this included (what is
to-day not so common as a result of school training) a
working knowledge if not a full mastery of Latin, which,
as the universal literary language of the time, was an essential
part of the training of all printer-publishers. His work
as a printer was begun in Paris, but when he was twenty-five
years of age, he moved to Caen, in Normandy, a
town which, in connection with its University, was already
assuming importance as a literary and publishing centre.
The printing of books in Caen had been begun by Durandas
and Quijone as early as 1480, a few years after the
first German printers settled at Paris. Plantin completed
his apprenticeship with Macé (the second of the name)
and, in 1546, married and moved to Antwerp, where he
secured citizenship and became a master-printer.</p>

<p>From the middle of the sixteenth century and until
the time of the great disasters brought on during the
revolt of the Netherlands, the “Spanish fury” of 1576,
and the great siege of 1585, Antwerp was at the height
of its prosperity, and in the extent and varied character
of its commercial relations, it was, possibly, the leading
city of Europe. While the enterprise and the genius for
commerce of the Netherlanders had brought into their
hands so large a proportion of the trade of the world, the
people were very far from being mere traders. Their
active-mindedness and incisive energy caused them to be
keenly interested in intellectual pursuits and in all pending
issues in religion, politics, and literature, while their
sturdiness of character gave them a respect for their own
opinions and made them ready to support these not only
with arguments, but, when the time came, with the devotion
of their lives. It is probable that, except in Florence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
Venice, and a few other communities in Italy, there
was no country in the world in which during the sixteenth
century intelligence and cultivation were so widely
diffused as in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Before the life and death struggle with Spain, the
differences between Flanders and Brabant in the South
and Holland and its sister provinces to the North were
much less strongly marked than was the case after the
division of the Netherlands had left one part Catholic
and one part Protestant, and had brought about, through
exiling over both borders, the concentration of the Protestants
in the free provinces of the North, and of the
Catholics in the provinces which remained under Spanish
rule in the South. At the time of Plantin’s settlement in
Antwerp, Flanders (using this term to cover roughly the
modern Belgium) contained a large Protestant population,
and the relations of the city with the towns of the
Northern provinces were active and intimate. The neighbouring
University of Louvain supplied the scholarly
coöperation which was so essential for all the publishing
undertakings of the age, while not a few scholars who,
a few years later, found themselves with the exiles in
Leyden or in Amsterdam, were at that time resident in
Antwerp, and were already largely associated with the
work of the printing-press.</p>

<p>It will be recognised, therefore, that Antwerp possessed
exceptional advantages as a centre of book-production, advantages
so great that they could not be entirely destroyed
even by “the Spanish fury,” the disastrous siege, and
the confirmation of the Spanish domination. In fact,
before the close of the fifteenth century, out of the sixty-five
printers who were at work in the Netherlands, no less
than thirteen were in Antwerp. At the time of Plantin’s
arrival, an entire quarter of the city was devoted to the
making of books, a circumstance at the time without a
parallel among the cities of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span></p>

<p>Plantin began his work in Antwerp as a binder, but he
shortly added to his business a shop for books. In 1555,
he entered upon his responsibilities as a printer and publisher
by the publication of a small volume entitled <i>Institution
d’une Fille de Noble Maison</i>. This was followed, in
the same year, by <i>Flores de l’anneo Seneca</i>, translated into
Spanish “with privilege of the magistracy.” The following
titles, selected from the publishing record and
catalogues, will give an impression of the general character

<li class="ifrst">1568. “La Bible Royale, ou Bible Polyglotte,” edited by Arias Montanus
and his collaborators.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was by far the most important work ever issued
by the printers of the Low Countries, and the most
scholarly edition of the Scriptures that had thus far been
put into print. A polyglot Bible had been planned by
Aldus but he had not lived to complete it. In 1517, the
Cardinal Ximenes had had printed at Alcala a polyglot
edition of the Old Testament, and, in 1547, an edition of
the Pentateuch, in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, and Syrian,
was printed in Constantinople under the supervision of
certain Jewish editors. Plantin secured for his Bible a
subvention (or at least the promise of a subvention) from
King Philip II. of 21,000 florins, which amount was to be
repaid to the King in copies of the book. The general
editor, Bénoît Arias Montanus, was appointed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
King, and Montanus associated with himself in the editorial
work certain members of the Theological Faculty
of the University of Louvain. The enterprise received
also the coöperation and support of Cardinal Granvelle.
One of the most important and also one of the most difficult
parts of the undertaking was the securing of the
various privileges required to authorise the sale of the
work and to protect it from infringement in the several
countries in which a demand for it was expected. A
general privilege was first obtained from the Governor-General
of the Netherlands, acting on behalf of the King,
and this secular authorisation was supplemented by a
certificate of orthodoxy issued by the Theological Faculty
of Louvain, which was naturally prepared to approve
of its own work. The Pope, Pius V., or his advisers, took
the ground, however, that any general circulation of the
Scriptures might prove dangerous, and in spite of the
approval given to the work by the Catholic theologians
of Louvain, he refused to sanction its publication. This
refusal blocked the undertaking for some years, and
brought upon Plantin serious financial difficulties in connection
with the heavy outlays already incurred. The
history of the undertaking presents a convenient example
of the special difficulties attending publishing enterprises
of the time. The examiners or censors, whether political
or ecclesiastical, were prepared to make their examinations
and to arrive at decisions only when the work in
question was already in printed form. It was necessary,
therefore, that the expenses of the editing, type-setting,
and printing should be incurred before the publisher could
ascertain whether or not the publication would be permitted.
It was quite possible also that the plan of the
publication might be approved by one authority while
the work, when completed, might fail to secure the sanction
of some other or succeeding authority. With Plantin’s
<i>Bible</i>, the history took a different course. Pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
Gregory XIII., who succeeded Pius V., was finally persuaded
to give his approval to the work, and, in 1572, he
issued a privilege for it which gave to the publisher an
exclusive control for the term of twenty years, and which
brought upon any reprinter excommunication and a fine
of two thousand livres. When the papal sanction had
been secured, the royal privilege covering all the dominions
of Spain, which, after first being issued, had been
withdrawn pending the papal decision, was confirmed for
twenty years. Other privileges were secured as follows:
From Germany, in the name of the Emperor Maximilian,
for ten years; from France, in the name of King Charles
IX., for twenty years; from Venice, in the name of the
Doge and the Senate, for twenty years, and from Naples
for twenty years. Montanus, after finishing his editorial
labours and supervising the printing of the final sheets of
the Bible, was obliged to devote some years to travelling
from Court to Court, and to a long sojourn in Rome, in
order to secure these privileges. Even after the work had
secured the approval of Gregory, it was vigorously attacked
by a group of the stricter Romanists, headed by
Professor Leon de Castro, of Salamanca. De Castro
took the ground that the Vulgate had been accepted by
the Church as the authoritative text, and that all attempts
to go back to the original Hebrew, Greek, or Syriac,
must, therefore, be sacrilegious. As early as 1520, Noel
Beda, Dean of the Faculty of Theology of the Sorbonne,
had taken similar ground in connection with the editions
of the Bible printed by Henry Estienne. Beda contended
that the study of Greek and Hebrew would bring religion
into peril, as it would tend to undermine the authority of
the Vulgate. When Montanus, after completing his work
in Antwerp, returned to Spain, he was accused of being
a partisan of the Jews and an enemy of the Church, and
was threatened with a trial for heresy. He was able,
however, through his own scholarship and with the backing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
of the Pope, to hold his own against his accusers, and
no formal trial ever took place. He died in Spain in
1598. He may be considered as the most distinguished
of the scholarly associates of the great Antwerp publisher,
his relations with whom were in many ways similar to
those which had obtained half a century earlier between
Erasmus and Froben of Basel.</p>

<p>The polyglot Bible, the result of the enterprise and
persistence of Plantin, and of the erudition, independence
of thought and courage of Montanus, survived all the
attacks that were made upon it, and remains one of the
greatest monuments as well of the erudition as of the
publishing enterprise of the sixteenth century. From a
financial point of view, the undertaking was, however, a
failure. It had probably been planned on too large a
scale, while the outlays were seriously increased and the
returns from sales not a little delayed and lessened in
connection with the many obstacles in the issue of the
privileges, and in connection also with the serious assaults
made upon the orthodoxy of the book by certain Spanish
ecclesiastics. The first edition printed had comprised
1213 copies, a considerable proportion of which were, five
years later, still in the hands of the publishers. Plantin
was left heavily in debt, the amount of the deficiency
being increased by the failure of King Philip to complete
the payment of the promised subsidy.</p>

<p>The more important of the publications of Plantin’s
Press which followed the big Bible, are as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1571. The “Psalterium,” printed with the aid of Cardinal Granvelle.
An “Index Expurgatorius,” prepared, under the direction of Philip II.,
for the use of the censors throughout the kingdom.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The preparation of the “Index” was confided to a college or commission
of ecclesiastics sitting at Antwerp, and comprising, among others, the Bishop
of Louvain and Arias Montanus. The “Index” specified what portions of
the books condemned contained heretical material, and the booksellers in
each town were charged to cut out the condemned pages and were permitted
to sell the books thus expurgated. The first of the “Indexes” issued in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
Low Countries had been printed in Louvain in 1546, by Seruacs van Sassen
(see reference later in this chapter).</li>

<li class="ifrst">1573. An “Antiphonaire,” printed with the aid of the Bishop of Tournai.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The “Hours” of the Virgin.</li>

<li class="ifrst">For this work, the Pope gave to the publisher a privilege (confirmed by
his representative in Brussels) covering all the countries of Europe.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1573. “Thesaurus Theutonicæ Linguæ,” a dictionary of French, Flemish,
and Latin.</li>

<li class="ifrst">This was edited by Cornelius Kiel, who was the most important of the
philological scholars associated with the Plantin Press.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Vivæ Imagines Partium Corporis Humani.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">1575. “Corpus Civile, Pandectæ, Codicis Justiniani,” twelve books.
A long series of Greek and Latin texts.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Origines Antwerpianæ,” by Becanius.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The author was a physician and an old friend of Plantin. His treatise
proves that Flemish is the most ancient of the mother tongues of the world.
The edition was paid for by the author, in whose name the royal privilege
was issued.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1576. The works of Tertullian, in three volumes.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Historia Frumentorum,” with eighty-four plates.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1581. Works of S. Augustine, in ten volumes.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Works of S. Jerome, in five volumes.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Ortellius, the Geographer, Maps and “Theatrum Orbis.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">Mercator, the Maps of.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1583. “Stirpium Historia Pomptades Sex.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">A Description of the Netherlands, by Guicciardini, printed, with many
illustrations, in German, Latin, French, Flemish, and Italian.</li>

<li class="ifrst">The elaborate plans of the cities were paid for by the municipalities interested.
The author received as his compensation one hundred and fifty
florins and a number of copies of the book.</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Humanæ Salutus monumenta,” by Arias Montanus, with seventy-two
plates.</li>

<li class="ifrst">1575-85. A long series of Musical Works, for the text of which special
fonts had to be made.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1567, Plantin coöperated with Paul Manutius (the
son of Aldus), who was at that time established in Rome,
in the production of a series of Breviaries, eleven in all.
Manutius had secured for the work a papal privilege
covering all the Catholic States, and as consideration for
the assignment of this privilege for the Netherlands,
Plantin was to pay one tenth of all the copies printed by
him. A royal privilege, confirming the papal sanction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
was secured from Philip II., who also advanced 2000
florins to facilitate the publication. Later, Plantin was
relieved from the payment to Manutius of the tenth, the
Pope having authorised, for the dominions of Philip, a
somewhat different form of Breviary. This undertaking
proved very remunerative.</p>

<p>In 1557, Plantin’s consignment to the Frankfort Fair
comprised no less than 1200 volumes, together with a
large assortment of prints from copper plates. He was
at this time, unquestionably, one of the two leading publishers
of the world, the other being Henry Estienne of
Geneva. In the publication of elaborately illustrated
works, of illustrations for separate sale, and of finely engraved
maps, his work represents an enormous advance
over anything that had before been attempted, and it is
difficult to-day to understand how the resources at his
command and the markets within his reach could have
been sufficient to warrant the production of works of
such magnitude and costliness.</p>

<p>In 1562, a grave misfortune came upon Plantin, which
caused serious interruption to his business, and consequent
loss. He was accused by the Margrave of Antwerp
of heresy, because there had been printed in his
establishment an edition of a treatise entitled <i>Brièfve
instruction pour prier</i>. Plantin was condemned <i>in absentio</i>
(he was at the time in Paris) and his goods were seized
and sold at auction. He was able, however, later, to
show that the book had been printed during his absence
and without his knowledge, and for the account not of
his own publishing concern but of some outside customer
of the printing-office, and he was finally acquitted. The
more important portion of the goods that had been sold
at auction had been bought in for him by personal friends,
so that he was shortly again in a position to go on with
his business. Some of these friends supplied further
capital, and, in 1563, a company was organised for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
printing and publishing of books, of which company
Plantin became manager.</p>

<p>Plantin came under suspicion of heresy a number of
times, but he was always able to present evidence of his
orthodoxy in the Catholic faith. It was, I understand,
only after his death that the documents were found showing
that, as early as 1550, he had been a member of a
sect known as <i>La Famille de la Charité</i>, the leader of
which was Niclaes. Plantin printed for Niclaes (but without
the imprint of his printing-office) the <i>Spiegel der
Gherechtigkeit</i> or <i>Le Miroir de la Justice</i>. He did not
fail, however, during these years, to continue to do whatever
was requisite to preserve his good standing in the
Church of Rome, a course that was certainly judicious at
a time when Antwerp was in charge of rulers like Alva,
and when the publisher was carrying on undertakings
which required the coöperation or the support of the
theologians of Louvain, of King Philip, and of the
Pope. Whatever the temptation or the necessities, it
seems certain that Plantin was willing, for the sake probably,
in the main, of his business interests, to act the
part of a trimmer, and it must be admitted that he played
the rôle skilfully and successfully.</p>

<p>The censorship of the Press, as far at least as Germany
and the Low Countries were concerned, began with the
time of Luther. Before the burning of the Papal Bull at
Wittenberg, the Press had enjoyed the same measure of
freedom as that accorded to other industries. On the
25th of May, 1521, an imperial edict of Charles V. ordered
that, thereafter, all books must, before being printed,
secure the approval of censors appointed for the purpose
under imperial authority. The first censors so appointed
were ecclesiastics, and the censorship appeared to have
reference only to matters of theological heresy. In the
same year, 1521, the Diet of Worms placed under condemnation
the writings of Luther. All existing copies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
of these writings were ordered destroyed, and those convicted
of printing, selling, or reading the same were
adjudged guilty of treason (<i>lèse-majesté</i>).</p>

<p>In 1529, a further imperial edict forbade the printing
of all books containing the new heresies, and forbade also
the printing (unless with the special sanction of the
Church) of any portion of the Scriptures. The penalty
for printing any book without the authorisation of the
Government was fixed at five florins gold. Two years
later, a supplementary edict added to this fine the punishment
of public exposure and of branding with a hot
iron, or of having an eye put out or the hand chopped
off, as the judge might decide.</p>

<p>In 1550, an imperial ordinance punished with death
those who printed or published the books condemned in
1529, and the fine for printing other books without authorisation
was raised to twenty florins gold. No one
could become a printer without an imperial license.
Booksellers could open their packages only in the presence
of the censors. They were obliged to post in their
shops the lists of books condemned, and also the lists
of the books kept in sale. The penalty for failure to do
this was fixed at one hundred florins. Under the direction
of King Philip II., the Inquisition took into its own
hands, in all the countries of his dominions, the supervision
and censorship of the Press.</p>

<p>In 1895, Mr. A. M. Huntington, of New York,
printed, at the De Vinne Press, reproductions in facsimile
of five of the <i>Indexes</i> issued during this period
under the authority of Charles V., of Philip II., and of
the Spanish Inquisition. The following brief summary
will give an impression of the purpose and character of
the group of <i>Indexes</i>, a group which can, I judge, be considered
as fairly characteristic of the whole series.</p>

<p>Text of the edict of his Imperial Majesty concerning books the circulation
of which is prohibited under the censorship of the doctors of the Faculty of
Theology in the University of Louvain; issued in the year 1546; printed at
Louvain by Seruacs van Sassen, 1546, with favour and privilege.</p>

<p>The monograph, which as printed in the edition of Mr. Huntington, comprises
about ninety pages, is made up as follows: I. The text of the
privilege. II. The full text of the edict (“Mandamêt”). The edict closes
with a list of the books the circulation of which is permitted, a list which includes:
the “Syntaxis” of Erasmus, “Grammaticæ” by several authors,
“Fabulae Æsopæ,” the “Dialectica” and “Rhetorica” of Agricola, editions
of the “Letters” of Cicero, of the works of Virgil, Lucan, Horace,
Cæsar, Livy, the “Orations” of Cicero, the writings of Boëthius, the works of
Gaza and of Laskaris, the works of Lucian, of Isocrates, Xenophon, Horace,
Aristophanes, Hesiod, and Plutarch, and the “Orations” of Demosthenes.
III. An address to readers by the Theological Faculty of Louvain. IV. A
list of the forbidden books, comprising: the editions of the Bible issued by
Robert Estienne of Paris, Goinus of Antwerp, Savoris of Lyons, Boule of
Lyons, Cæsar of Antwerp, Froben of Basel (this last was probably the
edition with the notes of Erasmus), Stelsium of Antwerp, Gabianus of Lyons,
Regnault of Paris, Gryphium of Paris, Paganus of Lyons, Münster of Basel,
the Greek editions of the Bible by Argentoratus. Dutch editions as follows:
Liesuelt of Antwerp, Vorsterma of Antwerp, Peeters of Antwerp. Flemish
editions as follows: by Martinus of Antwerp, by Antoninus of Antwerp.
Editions of the New Testament as follows: by Robert Estienne of Paris, by
Maranus of Antwerp, by Batman of Antwerp. Editions of the New Testament
in Dutch as follows: by Gymmick of Cologne, by Cornelius of Antwerp,
by Lieseult, by Godifredus of Antwerp, by Keyser of Antwerp, by Petrus of
Leyden, by Van Loe of Antwerp, by Crom of Antwerp, by Mirdmans of Antwerp,
by Coch of Antwerp, by Claes of Antwerp, by Hage of Antwerp; the
New Testament in Flemish by De Monte of Antwerp, by Petrus of Antwerp,
and by Richart of Antwerp. This list includes in all forty-nine editions of the
Bible and of the New Testament. The schedule of Bibles is followed by a
list of works, also prohibited, aggregating one hundred and fifty-eight titles.
In addition to the books prohibited by name, this division of the <i>Index</i>
includes a prohibition of “all the writings” of the following authors:
Luther, Wiclif, Huss, Massilius of Padua, Oecolampadius, Zwingli, Melanchthon,
Lambertus, Pomerinus, Brunselsius, Justus Jonas. I add a
selection of the more noteworthy titles from the list of separate works:</p>
<ul>
<li class="ifrst">“Historia de Germanorum Origine.”</li>
<li class="ifrst"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> 
 “Commentaria Pythagoræ poema.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Erasmi Scholia in Evangelium Secundum.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Matthaeum, Marcum, et Lucam.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Erasmi Postilla in Evangelia dominicalia, per totum annum.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Epitome Chronicorum Latine et Teutonice.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Agrippa de Vanitate Scientiarum.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Chronicon regum et regnorum, authore Paulo Constatino Phrygione.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“In Joannis Catacuzeni contra fide Mahumeticam librû præfatio, Gualteri
Tigurini.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Geographia Universalis, Basileæ, per Petri.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Joachimi Camerarii Commentarii in Tusculano quæstionis Ciceronis.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Paidalogia Petri Mosellani.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“Judocus Uvelichius de pronunciatione Rhetorica.”</li>

<li class="ifrst">“La Louainge du Mariage et recueil des Histoires de bonnes (vertueuses)
et illustres femmes, composée par Maistre Pierre de Lesuanderie.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The greater portion of the list is devoted to the controversial works of
Protestant writers, works which we should expect to find in such an Index.
It is, however, somewhat surprising that the Divines of Louvain should have
thought it necessary to place their condemnation also upon such apparently
innocent productions as treatises on the origin of the “Germans” or on
“Universal Geography,” or on the “Tusculan Disputations” of Cicero, and
it is difficult to understand the ground on which these should have been considered
as likely to prove dangerous to the true Faith.</p>

<p>In the spelling of the titles, I have followed Mr. Huntington’s text, which
has, I understand, been reproduced from the original by a photographic process.</p>

<p>The lists in the several <i>Indexes</i> repeat titles very largely, and in nearly all,
after the writings of an author have been condemned <i>in toto</i> under some
such head as “opera omnia,” a number of them are afterwards condemned
under their separate titles.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">II. THE LOUVAIN INDEX OF 1550.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This comprises the following material: A catalogue of the books condemned
according to the judgment of the University of Louvain, and under
an edict of “his Cæsarean Majesty” (this list is in part a repetition of that
of 1546); a Bull of the Holy Father, Pope Julius III., against all those
possessing or reading copies of the forbidden or condemned books; a further
catalogue of books previously condemned under the authority of the
most illustrious and reverend Lord Don Ferdinand of Valdes, Archbishop
of Seville, Inquisitor-General of the Council of the holy general Inquisition;
together with the edict of the apostolic inquisitors in the city of Toledo,
under whose decree the titles of several later books are added to the original
list. The <i>Index</i> was printed in Toledo in the office of Joh. de Ajala, in
1551. The title-page closes with a clause inflicting excommunication and a
fine of 50,000 maravedas upon those who may sell or possess copies of the
works condemned.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span></p>
<p>Following the title, comes an address to the reader from the Rector and
Faculty of the University.</p>

<p>The Louvain catalogue comprises 295 titles, of which 62 are of works in
Flemish and in Dutch, and 233 of works in Latin. The Archbishop’s
catalogue comprises 69 titles, of which 55 are of works in Latin and 14 of
works in Spanish. In the Louvain list are included certain specific writings
of Erasmus, and also his entire works (“Opera Omnia”). Erasmus was
himself the most distinguished student whom Louvain had sent out. There
are also editions of the Bible as printed in Paris by Robert Estienne, the
works of Luther, Zwingli, Melanchthon and other Reformers, etc. The
Latin books are from presses in Paris, Antwerp, Basel, Cologne, The
Hague, etc. The Flemish and Dutch titles are from Antwerp, Ghent,
Middelburg, and Leyden. The Archbishop’s Latin list includes the Koran
and “all books containing the errors of Mahomet,” the writings of Servetus,
Œcolampadius, and Zwingli, and the “Colloquies” of Erasmus. His
Spanish list includes “all books printed in Hebrew,” and “all theological
works printed in Arabic”; also “all editions of the Bible printed in the
vulgar tongue.”</p>
</div>

<p class="center">III. THE SAME LOUVAIN INDEX OF 1550.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Printed in Cordova, by Francisco Ferdinand in 1551. This volume
includes, in addition to the titles of the books condemned by the Divines of
Louvain, a list of thirty works sanctioned by the University for use as text-books.
Among these are a Syntax, a Greek Grammar, a “Copia,” and a
Guide to letter-writing, by Erasmus of Rotterdam, volumes which under
a strict construction of language might naturally be understood to be
included among the “Opera Omnia” of Erasmus, condemned in the
previous list.</p>

<p>Following the list of the text-books authorised, is the catalogue of the
books previously condemned by the Inquisition, comprising eighty-five
titles. This includes various writings of Erasmus, Luther, Servetus, Melanchthon,
Zwingli, and other Reformers, also all versions of the Bible in
Spanish or in other vulgar tongues.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">IV. THE CORDOVA INDEX OF 1554.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is described on its title-page as a “Censura Generalis contra errores,
quibus recentes haeretici Sacram Scriptorem asperserunt, edita a supremo
senatu Inquisitionis adversus hereticam provitatem et apostasiam in Hispania,
et aliis regnis, et dominiis Cæsareæ Majestatis constituto.”</p>

<p>It was printed at Cordova by Francisco Ferdinand, and was sold for forty
maravedas.</p>

<p>The volume contains an edict of the King (printed in Spanish) approving
the list as constituted; a statement (printed in Latin) from Ferdinand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Archbishop and Inquisitor-General, of the reasons for the condemnation of
the heretical interpretations that had been permitted to obscure or to dishonour
certain passages of the Scriptures and also other Sacred writings;
the same printed in Spanish; an Introduction (<i>Præfatio</i>) to the list of condemned
texts; a list of the editions of the Bible which at this time call for
correction and condemnation.</p>

<p>The list comprises forty-seven editions. Of these, twenty-eight are
printed in Lyons, eight in Paris, six in Basel, three in Venice, one in Antwerp
and one in Tigurium. The Paris editions include those of Robert
Estienne, who was at this time engaged in his long fight with the Sorbonne.
The Lyons list contains the title of the great Bible of Hugo, later reprinted
by Koberger in Nuremberg. The schedule of Bibles is followed by a list
of one hundred and thirty texts from the Old and New Testaments, together
with the heretical interpretations and the orthodox refutations and corrections
of these. Then comes a general condemnation of all the errors which
are to be found in the Bibles that have been thus corrupted by the heretics,
with an enumeration of the chapters misinterpreted. A Bible printed at
Basel by John Oporimus, receives the honour of a special condemnation,
with which the volume closes.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">V. THE VALLADOLID INDEX OF 1559.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a catalogue of the books which are prohibited according to the
mandate of the most illustrious and reverend Doctor Ferdinand of Seville,
Inquisitor-General of Spain, and under the authority of the Supreme Senate
of the Holy Inquisition. It was printed at Valladolid, by Sebastian Martinez,
in 1559, and was sold for seven reals.</p>

<p>The volume includes a special edict of the Archbishop, prohibiting the
printing of this <i>Index</i> by any one but Martinez.</p>

<p>Following the title-page is a letter from Pope Paul IV. to Ferdinand,
setting forth the necessity of protecting the orthodox faith against the
assaults of the heretics.</p>

<p>The schedule of books prohibited comprises about 620 titles, of which
350 are in Latin, 140 in Spanish, and 120 in Dutch. This is followed by a
supplementary list of 32 titles, comprising 12 in German, 10 in French, and
10 in the (vulgar) Lusitanian tongue.</p>

<p>Among the noteworthy titles in the two schedules I find “The Koran,”
Commentaries on Aristotle by Hegendorf, a long series of Bibles from the
presses of Robert Estienne and others, the works of Melanchthon, the
works of Gesner, various writings of Hegendorf, a long series of writings of
Erasmus, specified by separate titles, followed by his complete works,
“Opera Omnia,” the works of Bullinger, the works of Cornelius Agrippa,
the works of Jerome Cardan, the works of Calvin, Huss, Œcolampadius,
and Servetus, the “Commentaries” of Julius Cæsar, edited by Tigurinus,
the works of Reuchlin, the “Lexicon of Civil Law,” by Spiegel, the works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
of Luther, Bucerus, and Börrhaus, the “De Officiis” of Cicero, edited by
Betuleus, the same, edited by Melanchthon, the writings of Peter Martyr,
the works of Dolet, the works of Ulrich von Hutten.</p>

<p>The Spanish list includes the versions in Spanish of several books of
Erasmus, who appears to have been one of the most thoroughly “condemned”
and at the same time one of the most widely circulated authors of
Europe; also all the editions in the vernacular of the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>It was doubtless the case, as has been indicated in previous chapters, that
the general circulation of these official <i>Indexes</i> had the effect of calling
public attention to the books described and unquestionably kept certain
writings in demand which would otherwise have been lost sight of very
speedily.</p>

<p>The general circulation of the books of more permanent importance was
also materially furthered by the information given in these official denunciations,
information which was particularly serviceable at a time when there
were so many difficulties in the way of making known to the public the
existence of books. The ecclesiastical condemnation undoubtedly blocked
the use of certain books as texts in the universities, but the surreptitious
sales probably more than offset the circulation which was lost in this way.
An incidental result was probably the furthering the sale of unauthorised
editions at the expense of those issued by the authorised publishers. This
interference was bitterly complained of, for instance by Erasmus.</p>
</div>

<p>It is convenient to make reference here to the earlier
regulations for the censorship of the Press, as well in
order to make clear the conditions under which the publishers
of Antwerp had to carry on their business, as
because Plantin himself held an important post among
the newly-appointed censors. In 1569, Philip II. instituted
the office of proto-typographer, or supervisor of
printing for the Netherlands. Master-printers applying
to the supervisor for authorisation for a work to be
printed, must show the certificate of approval of the diocesan
bishop or of his vicar, and also of the local magistrate.
Printers were required to take an oath of conformity
to the doctrines of the Church as set forth by the Council
of Trent. In 1570, Philip II. appointed Plantin proto-typographer.
No remuneration was attached to the
office, but the incumbent was freed from the duty of
lodging soldiers. The important service of the post for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Plantin was, of course, the increased facility it secured
for him in obtaining approvals and privileges for his own
publications. The theologians of Louvain (through
whom the ecclesiastical censorship for Antwerp was, in
the main, carried on) were not likely to raise question
concerning the undertakings of the literary representative
of the King. In fact, after 1570, Plantin took the title
of “Printer to the King,” a title which proved of service
during the years of war when the Southern provinces
were being harried for heretics by the Spanish officials.
Even the printer for the King could not, however, ensure
the protection and profitable continuance of his business
during times of civil war, and notwithstanding the pains
he had taken to make himself safe with both parties to
the great contest, the period was, for Plantin (as for Antwerp
traders generally) one of serious difficulty, and
nearly brought him to ruin.</p>

<p>In 1576, the troubles which had for a number of years
been gathering force, brought about the league or union
of the seventeen provinces, described as the Pacification of
Ghent, and in the same year came the sack of Antwerp
(known as the “Spanish Fury”). At this time Plantin
had twenty-five presses, and about one hundred and fifty
employees. According to his biographer, Rooses, the
work of his printing-office was not at any period of the
struggle entirely stopped, but it had gradually dwindled
until, in 1585, when the authority of the King over the
city of Antwerp had been finally established, Plantin had
but one press at work, and that was the only press at the
moment in operation throughout the city. The war had
brought about a separation of the Netherlands, giving to
the new Dutch Republic the Protestant States of the
North, and leaving under the control of Spain the territory
corresponding, in the main, to modern Belgium, the
population of which was (after the Protestants had been
killed or driven into exile) chiefly Catholic. One result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
of the contest and of this concentration of Protestantism
in the Republic was to transfer to Amsterdam the larger
share of the trade of which Antwerp had heretofore been
the centre, and with this general trade departed also, in
great measure, the publishing business and the literary
activities of the city of the Scheldt.</p>

<p>By the year 1585, the independence of the new Dutch
Republic, while not formally recognised until a number of
years later, was practically assured. In the Southern
provinces, however, of which Antwerp was the chief city,
the authority of the Spanish King was restored. The
business of the city was resumed, but under sadly changed
conditions. The city itself had been seriously devastated
by the siege and ransacked by the Spanish troops. Many
of the enterprising citizens who had been leaders in its
trade and in its civic history had lost their lives, while
many others, convicted or suspected of Protestant views,
had been forced into exile or had voluntarily cast in their
lot with their Protestant friends in the Dutch cities.</p>

<p>Antwerp was left impoverished as to both men and
resources. Her ships had disappeared, her commerce
had been brought to a standstill. The war had been
harassing and exhausting also for the States of the Republic,
but they had won their independence, and had
never lost their control of the sea. Their losses in men
were, in part at least, offset by the immigration of Protestants
from the provinces which had remained subject
to the Spanish yoke, while their losses in property were
to be speedily made good by the profits of a rapidly
increasing trade.</p>

<p>Among the industries of Antwerp which suffered most
seriously was, as may easily be understood, that of the
production of books. The departing Protestants had
taken with them much of the intellectual life and of the
literary activity of the city, while Amsterdam and Leyden,
free from the hampering restrictions of Catholic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
censorship, presented many advantages for publishing
undertakings. Plantin refused, however, to be discouraged,
and beginning his work again in 1585, with one
printing-press, was able in the course of the next two
years to reorganise an effective establishment. The office
of proto-typographer had fallen into desuetude, but Plantin
still called himself Printer to the King.</p>

<p>His first publication for the new year was an official list
of the books at that time under prohibition, a list comprising,
in one hundred and nineteen pages, some six hundred
titles. Various similar lists had been published during
the preceding half century. In 1546, Charles V. had had
printed in Worms a list of heretical books the circulation
and possession of which were forbidden; and in the same
year, the same list, with a few additions, was printed in
Louvain, by Van Sassen, also under the instructions of
Charles. A fuller specification of this Louvain <i>Index</i> of
1546 has been given on an earlier page. In 1551, the
Faculty of the Sorbonne published, through Jean
André, of Paris, a similar list. The first <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>
of the Inquisition was printed in 1554, in
Venice, by Julitus, and in 1559, this was reprinted in
Rome, in Aragon, at Pforzheim, and in Cologne. The
four <i>Indexes</i> printed in Spain between 1550 and 1559
have been already referred to. There need, therefore,
have been no lack of information on the part of printers
or booksellers as to the books the production and
distribution of which were forbidden under various
penalties. It seems probable, however, as previously
said, that, with the possible exception of Spain, the
placing on the <i>Index</i> of the title of a book, constituted
for it a valuable advertisement, serving to increase the
circulation of works of distinctive character, and even
securing a continuity of repute and of influence for not a
few books of less intrinsic importance which would otherwise
have fallen into oblivion. It was hardly effective,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
for instance, to prevent the printing of a book in Paris,
when the heretically disposed readers in France could
easily be reached by the productions of the presses of
Geneva; and in like manner, to the printers of Leyden
and Amsterdam the censorship of the Roman ecclesiastics
was of no importance excepting as ensuring a demand
for their heretical publications among readers in the
easily reached territory of France or of the Spanish
Netherlands.</p>

<p>The account books of Plantin have been preserved,
giving the records of his undertakings during the larger
portion of his business activity. Among the entries of
disbursements which have an interest for readers of to-day
are those recording the payments for editorial service
or for other literary work. In a number of cases, these
payments, whether to authors or to editors, were made
in the shape of copies of the book on which the work had
been done.</p>

<p>Thus, Jean Isaac received, in 1554, in full for the copyright
of his Hebrew Grammar, a hundred copies of the
book, while, in the year following, he was paid for his
abridgment of the Hebrew Dictionary of Pagnino, the
sum of fifteen crowns. Dodonaeus, in 1565, accepted
fifty copies of his <i>Frumentorum Historia</i> (which had been
a very expensive work to produce). Hunnaeus, in 1566,
was given two hundred copies of his <i>Dialectica</i>. Pierre
de Savonne, for a treatise on book-keeping, was paid, in
1567, forty-five florins and one hundred copies; Guicciardini,
for a Description of the Poetry of the Low Countries,
received eighty-two florins and fifty copies. Stadius,
for his <i>Commentaries</i> on Florus, was paid, in 1567, twenty
florins; Carrion, for editorial work on <i>Sallust</i>, fourteen
florins; Venutius, for a Spanish translation of the <i>Theatrum
Orbis</i>, was paid one hundred florins; while Everaert,
for the translation into Flemish of Porta’s <i>Magia Naturalis</i>,
received fifteen florins. The four theological professors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
of Louvain who revised the <i>Bible Française</i>, were
paid each twenty-five florins.</p>

<p>Plantin had on his permanent staff a number of correctors
and revisers. Ghisebrecht, with a knowledge of
Latin and Greek, and with capacity to edit texts, received
board and lodging and sixty florins yearly, and Van der
Eynde, with a somewhat larger range of scholarship, was
paid yearly one hundred and fifty to two hundred and
ten florins. Plantin had, in the organisation of his staff,
a more complicated task than had fallen upon his publishing
predecessors. The books of Aldus, Badius, and
Estienne had been published almost exclusively in Latin
or in Greek. With the enlargement of the range in the
demand for books adapted for the wider education of
the generation supplied by Plantin, it became necessary
to provide reading material in the vernacular. Latin,
while still the language of scholarship, was ceasing to
be the exclusive language of literature. It was further
the case that the publishing undertakings of the second
half of the sixteenth century were no longer limited to
reissues of the works of classic writers. Plantin’s list
included the writings of a considerable number of contemporary
authors. The work of providing literature of
the day for readers of the day had begun to take shape,
and Plantin was the first of the mediæval publishers
whose books were deliberately planned for what to-day
would be called a popular circulation. With this widening
of the circle of readers, came at once a problem
which, for a capital like Antwerp and for dominions like
those of the King of Spain, presented special complexities.
Plantin’s catalogue of 1566 included works in
Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, German, Spanish, Italian,
Flemish, Dutch, and English. In order properly to
supervise for the compositors the text of works in these
various tongues, and in order to ensure a correct reading
of the proofs, it was, of course, necessary to secure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
services of editors, proof-readers, and compositors who
possessed a scholarly, or at least a working knowledge of
the languages in question. A similar requirement obtained
in the publishing-office, the business of which had
to be conducted in three or four languages. It was
necessary, therefore, for Plantin’s purposes, to employ a
polyglot staff, a necessity which had obtained to a much
smaller degree with the contemporary publishers in Paris,
Basel, or Nuremberg, and which at that time hardly
called for consideration in London.</p>

<p>Among the regulations of both the office and the
workshop was one forbidding the discussion of religious
or political questions. Bearing in mind the variety of
nationality of the employees in the establishment, and
bearing in mind also the bitterness with which religious
and political questions were held at the time of the revolt
of the Dutch provinces, a regulation of this kind was
certainly sensible enough. Plantin had the reputation
of being in his business methods precise and systematic,
and the records of his business which have been preserved,
present evidence to this effect. He was certainly
popular with his employees, although strict and exacting.
He accepted, in framing the regulations for the work of
the establishment, the coöperation of delegates from his
own workmen, and in the few instances in which serious
differences of opinion arose, and in the one or two cases
of strikes, the difficulties were finally adjusted with the
aid of this coöperating committee of the workmen.</p>

<p>Of the more popular works published by him, the editions
ranged from one thousand to fifteen hundred copies.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Frumentorum Historia</i> (issued in 1566) eight
hundred copies were printed. Of the sixteenmo edition
of <i>Virgil</i>, issued in 1564, he printed 2500 copies. An
edition of the <i>Pentateuch</i>, printed in 1566, comprised
3900 copies, while of the complete <i>Scriptures</i>, issued in
the succeeding year, the edition was 2500.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span></p>

<p>The selling prices of Plantin’s publications appear low
as compared with the prices of to-day, and taking into
consideration the necessary limitations of circulation. I
quote a few examples selected from the catalogue of
1576.</p>

<p>The florin of Plantin’s catalogue was the equivalent of
about forty cents. The average discount given by him
to his book-selling customers was fifteen per cent. The
agent in charge of the Paris branch received forty per
cent.</p>

<p>In 1579, Plantin consigned to the Fair at Frankfort 5212
copies of sixty-seven works. During 1570, he sent to his
Paris agent books to the value of 19,000 florins. Perez,
of Salamanca, was his agent for Spain, where a branch
office was carried on at first for the account of the Antwerp
concern, and, later, as an independent House. The
annual sales through Salamanca of the Plantin publications
ranged from 5000 florins to 15,000 florins. In 1579,
Plantin had in plan the establishment of a branch in
London, but in connection with the difficulties brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
on by the war, this scheme failed to take shape. To one
correspondent in London his sales, in 1568, amounted to
4400 florins.</p>

<p>The average price of a quarter of a sou per sheet made
the cost of an octavo volume of three hundred and
twenty pages something less than four francs. The
paper and the ink used were of decidedly better quality
than those that can be purchased by the most exacting
publishers of to-day. Scholarly service could be obtained
from editors and authors at very moderate rates, while
the labour of the employees was also low priced. The
general purchasing power of money three centuries ago
was far greater than to-day, and can possibly be estimated
between, for instance, Antwerp of 1560 and London
of 1890, as worth three times as much, valued by its
equivalent in food and clothing. In 1577, Plantin sold
his shop in Paris to his agent Sonnius, accepting for the
business a sacrifice price. The Netherlands had been
devastated by years of war; trade was practically at a
standstill, and Plantin was in pressing need of funds.</p>

<p>In 1575, the University of Leyden was founded by
William of Orange, in commemoration of the success of
the Dutch the year before in raising the siege of the city.
Notwithstanding the absorption of the resources of the
country in the fierce struggle for independence and for
national existence, the University secured almost at once
an honourable position and speedily became one of the
most influential centres of scholarship in Europe. The
printing and publishing business of the town began with
the life of its University. The publishers secured important
service from the scholars of the Faculty, and
were able on their part to do much to further the work
of higher education. The printing-office of Louis Elzevir
(the first) whose family name was, later, to become so
famous in the annals of publishing, had been established,
but was already in difficulties. In 1583, Plantin found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
it convenient to leave Antwerp for a time, to escape
the pressure of his creditors. The war had undermined
his business, and he was also seriously hampered by the
failure of King Philip to make payment of the amount
due for the great Bible, or to pay a certain pension
which had been promised him and on which he had been
depending.</p>

<p>Plantin made his way to Leyden at the instance of the
historian Lipsius, whom he had known at Louvain and
who had recently accepted a Chair in the new University.
He purchased the establishment in which the work of
Louis Elzevir had been begun three years before, and he
put Elzevir in charge of his Leyden presses. The
founder of the long line of printers was able thus to
secure under the supervision of the veteran Plantin a
training which in later years stood him in good stead.
Louis Elzevir was himself one of the Protestant exiles
from Flanders, having begun his work as a binder in
Louvain. Plantin apparently had in view, for a time, a
permanent removal of his home and of his business interests
to Leyden. He was discouraged about the future of
the half ruined city of Antwerp, and was indignant with
King Philip for his failure to fulfil the obligations on the
strength of which Plantin had entered upon important
undertakings. He also realised how important a group
of the learned authors and editors upon whose coöperation
he was dependent for the scholarly portion of his
undertakings, had cast in their lot with the Protestants,
while it was further the case that the Protestant States
presented a much better market for the publisher than
could be depended upon in the Catholic communities
where both the production and the reading of books were
supervised by a rigorous ecclesiastical censorship.</p>

<p>Plantin’s Catholic affiliations, and his old-time official
connection with the Spanish Government do not appear
to have caused any difficulty in his work in Leyden or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
have aroused any serious antagonism on the part of the
sturdy Protestants of the University. If there was any
theological opposition, it was probably offset by the belief
that the settling in Leyden of the man who ranked as
perhaps the greatest printer-publisher in Europe, must
bring prestige and advantage to both city and University.
It was doubtless on this ground that, in 1584, Plantin
received the appointment of Printer to the University.
He was the second to hold the position, his predecessor,
Silvius, having died in office. The annual stipend was
fixed at two hundred florins. Notwithstanding this honourable
reception, Plantin could not make up his mind to
remain in Leyden. He was now an old man, and exile
from the city with which were connected nearly all the
associations of his long years of active life, was probably
felt as a hardship. In November, 1585, he transferred
the Leyden printing to his son-in-law, Raphelengius (who
also succeeded him as Printer to the University) and
returned to Antwerp. There he met with criticism from
his Catholic friends, who had heard that he had become
a heretic. He was able, however, to make a successful
defence of his orthodoxy, and there seems, in fact, to
have been no ground for the accusation that for the sake
of business advantage in Leyden, he had abjured the
faith of his fathers. One may gather, however, from his
experience both in Leyden and in Antwerp, that Plantin
held his Catholic doctrine with no very great strenuousness,
and it was quite natural that his long association
with critical scholars, many of them Protestants, should
have prevented him from being in any way a fierce
Romanist, and should have furthered the development in
him of a spirit of toleration. It is possible also that his
personal grievance against the King had strengthened
the indignation that any good citizen of Antwerp may
well have felt at the dogmatic and relentless policy which
had brought such disasters upon the city. Great as had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
been her misfortunes, however, the spirit and energy of
the Flemish capital had by no means been destroyed,
and by the time of Plantin’s return, a decided revival of
the trade and industries of the city had taken shape. In
1586, the printing and publishing offices were reconstructed,
and a year later the business was fairly re-established,
no less than forty works being issued within the
twelve months.</p>

<p>In 1589, was published the <i>Martyrology</i> of Baronius,
the last work completed under Plantin’s personal supervision.
He died in the latter part of the same year,
being then seventy-five years of age. By his will, the
larger portion of the property in Antwerp, together with
the responsibility for its direction, was left to his son-in-law,
John Moretus, who had for some years had a part
in its management. Plantin had no sons, but appears to
have been exceptionally fortunate in his sons-in-law. He
had had seven daughters, six of whom lived to be married.
John Moretus was the husband of the eldest. The
third had married Raphelengien or Raphelengius, who had
taken over, before Plantin’s death, the printing-office at
Leyden, and who, as Printer for the University, issued
an important series of scholarly and scientific works.
Later, he was made Professor of Hebrew, uniting with
the responsibilities of an instructor the work of a printer.</p>

<p>The printing and publishing business of the Plantin
House in Antwerp was largely expanded by Balthasar
Moretus, son of John who died in 1641. The work of
the printing establishment continued in the hands of
Plantin’s descendants until 1867, and the concern had,
therefore, a continuous existence of nearly three centuries,
being at the time its work terminated, probably
the oldest book-manufacturing firm in the world. In
1867, the buildings of the Plantin Press were purchased
by the city of Antwerp for 1,200,000 francs, and the
Plantin Museum was instituted. In this museum are exhibited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
all the details of book-making in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, together with the earlier records
and correspondence of the firm, the series of which has
been preserved nearly complete. As far as can be judged
from this correspondence, and from memoirs of the men
of letters and others with whom the great Antwerp publisher
had dealings, his relations with his authors, editors,
and correspondents generally were thoroughly harmonious
and satisfactory both ways. The years of Plantin’s business
career had been troublous ones, and had brought
with them many disasters, losses, and perplexities. He
appears, however, to have been exceptionally successful
in avoiding quarrels and disputes. The only client with
whom he had an issue was King Philip, and the only
lawsuit in which he was engaged was that brought against
him for heresy (<i>in absentio</i>) by the censorship of Antwerp.
This is an extremely creditable record for a publisher who
carried on such extended and varied undertakings, and
who, in many of his arrangements with authors, was
obliged himself to make the business precedents. The
authors must have been fairly satisfied, for in the long
series of the letters of the publishing business, there are
practically no complaints; and there is no record of anything
in the shape of an issue or even of a serious
difference of opinion between Plantin and any of his
correspondents, either commercial or literary.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Lipsius,
writing to Montanus (while Plantin was still active), says:
<i>Si la race de Plantin venait à faillir, je ne croirais plus
à personne au monde; l’amour et confiance que l’auteur
de la ligne m’a inspirée, je les transporte sur tous ses
proches</i>. After the death of the publisher, Lipsius speaks
of him as <i>l’ami qu’il avait aimé et qui l’avait aimé plus
fidèlement que personne</i>.</p>

<p>Plantin read, wrote, and spoke French, Spanish, German,
Flemish, and Latin, and had some knowledge of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>English and Italian. While making no claim to scholarship,
he had scholarly tastes and ideals, and he knew how
to select scholars as associates and workers in the undertakings
planned by him. He may also be classed with
the artists. In the sixteenth century, typography was a
liberal art, and Plantin was in typography an artist and
a liberal artist. He was, further, also the first publisher
to associate with typography on any large scale the work
of the engraver, and the series of copper plates produced
under his direction for his great series of illustrated works,
constituted an enormous advance in artistic publishing.
While Plantin cannot take rank with Aldus as a great
man, he may fairly be described as a great publisher. He
possessed imagination, courage, high ideals, and public
spirit, and he showed himself not infrequently more ambitious
to do important work for literature than to amass
wealth.</p>

<p class="center">THE ELZEVIRS OF LEYDEN AND AMSTERDAM.</p>

<p class="center">1587-1688.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">THE name of Elzevir has for more than two centuries
been a familiar one to collectors of choice books.
These Dutch printer-publishers of the seventeenth
century were able to associate their imprint with certain
publications of such distinctive typographical excellence
as to ensure for the editions known as “Elzevirs” a
prestige that has endured to the present day. Aldus
alone among the early publishers has had a similar fortune,
and while the “Aldine” editions are, of course, in
respect to their number and to their typographical excellence,
much less important than the “Elzevirs,” it must
be remembered that having been issued more than a century
earlier, their production called for a much larger
measure of originating capacity and initiative on the part
of their printer-publisher. The principal authority on
the history of the Elzevirs is a comprehensive and carefully
written monograph of Alphonse Willems, published
in Brussels in 1880.</p>

<p>Louis Elzevir, who, as far as its publishing undertakings
are concerned, was the founder of the family, had
been brought up as a binder in the Flemish University
town of Louvain. He was a Protestant, and in 1580,
when existence for Protestants had been made difficult in
the Catholic provinces of Flanders, Elzevir, in company
with hundreds of others of his faith, made his way across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
the border to Holland, and settled, with his family, at
Leyden. He was at this time about forty years of age.
Leyden was, in 1580, next to Amsterdam, the most considerable
and the most important city in Holland. The
heroic resistance that its citizens had made during the
long siege by the Spaniards had earned fame for the city
throughout all Protestant Europe, while the University,
which had been founded by William the Silent in commemoration
of the glory of the struggle, had at once
secured for itself a prestige among the scholars of Europe,
and in making Leyden a centre for the literary activities
of the Dutch provinces, had given a great incentive to its
publishing and printing trade.</p>

<p>Louis Elzevir found at Leyden a considerable group of
Flemish Protestants who had, like himself, found it wise
to get away from the rule of the Spanish soldiers and of
the Roman ecclesiastics who were dominating Flanders.
Among these exiles were certain men whose names became
known, later, in connection with literature or with
the work of the University, such as Vulcanius, Drusius,
d’Audenard, Lipsius, Stevin, Heinsius, Baudius, Polyander,
and Silvius, the first Printer to the University.</p>

<p>Elzevir began work as a book binder for the students
and instructors of the University, adding to this business,
a little later, a book-selling shop. The undertaking
proved, however, unsuccessful. During the troublous
times in which the new nation was still struggling against
the power of Spain for the right to exist, the number of
students in the University was at best but limited, and in
Leyden as in Heidelberg, Erfurt, and other of the German
universities of the time, the practice of hiring or borrowing
text-books, or of arranging in some manner to make
one or two volumes serve for the requirements of an
entire class, must have interfered not a little with the
possibility of securing a living from the post of University
bookseller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>

<p>Louis found himself, therefore, obliged to give up his
first place of business, but he was not willing to confess
himself defeated. During his brief experience as a bookseller,
he had been able to impress himself favourably
upon some of the authorities of the University, and in his
present distress he applied to them for help. The University
council, recognising the value for higher education
of the service to be rendered by a skilled and conscientious
bookseller, gave him permission to construct within
the limits of the University court a small book-shop, and
authorised Elzevir to announce himself officially as the
bookseller, and, later, as the publisher, to the University.</p>

<p>With this fresh starting point, Louis succeeded, after
some years of persistent and painstaking labour, in creating
an assured business foundation. He had never mastered
the art of printing, and the typographical work of
the publications issued with his name was done under
contract with different printers, and presented no feature
of special excellence or distinctiveness. The works
selected, however, for Elzevir’s publishing list, together
with the books selected by him through Frankfort and
Paris for sale in his shop, gave evidence of a good literary
and scholarly ideal and of a continually widening range
of knowledge of existing literature.</p>

<p>His correspondence throughout France, Germany, and
Italy brought the name of the new University to the
knowledge of many literary circles, and established for
Leyden and for the towns of Holland which depended
upon Leyden for their foreign literature, connections
with the book-producing centres of Europe, connections
which were never thereafter to be severed. Louis was,
during the greater part of his lifetime, the only publisher
and bookseller of Holland having such foreign relations.
At the time when the new State was securing through
the force of arms and the skill of its ambassadors the
political recognition from the Courts of Europe upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
which its continued existence depended, its literary representative,
Louis Elzevir, was, in like manner, securing
for Dutch scholarship and for Dutch publishing enterprise
an honourable recognition from the scholars and
with the book-trade of Europe.</p>

<p>The first work published by Louis as a venture of his
own was an edition of <i>Eutropius</i>, issued in 1592. It was,
however, not until after 1594 that his publications began
to appear with any regularity. In 1595, he first utilised
as a trade-mark the design of an eagle grasping in its claw
seven darts, an emblem which was retained by the House
for nearly a third of a century.</p>

<p>The name of Louis Elzevir is chronicled for the first
time, in 1595, in the list of publishers offering books at
the Fair in Frankfort. From the year 1602 he appears
to have made regular annual sojourns in Paris. In the
<i>Journal</i> of Pierre de Lestoile, under date of August,
1609, is a reference to a purchase made by him from
Elvisier (<i>sic</i>) of Leyden, of a treatise (by Grotius) entitled
<i>Mare Liberum</i>, together with certain orations of Heinsius
and of Baudius. Lestoile goes on to say that the said
Elvisier had described to him the bequest recently made
by Baudius to the public library of Leyden of his collection
of books, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic,
Ethiopian, Persian, and Armenian, a collection estimated
by said Elvisier as worth not less than three thousand
crowns. It would appear from this reference that the
scholars and the publishers of Leyden must have had
available for their use an exceptionally comprehensive
reference library.</p>

<p>The more distinctive work of the Elzevirs began, however,
only after the death of Louis, which occurred in
1617. He left six sons, two of whom were carrying on
book-shops in Utrecht and The Hague, in affiliation with
the present concern in Leyden. One was in the service
of the Dutch East India Company, and a fourth had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
adopted the profession of an artist. The eldest and the
youngest, Matthew and Bonaventure, joined hands to
carry on the business of their father, a business which
they were able very largely to extend and develop. The
form of imprint, <i>ex officina Elzeviriana</i>, dates from the
year 1617, when the two young men assumed the direction
of the concern.</p>

<p>At the time the two young Flemings were beginning
work with their publishing operations, the independence
of the Dutch Republic, though not yet formally acknowledged
by Spain, was an assured fact, and the territory of
the seven United Provinces was free alike from invaders
and from civil strife. The Thirty Years’ War was, however
(in 1618), just beginning in Germany, and until the
peace of Westphalia, in 1648, the business connections of
dealers in books with the book-trade centres in Frankfort,
Leipzig, Cologne, etc., were, in common with all
trade operations on the Continent, very much interfered
with. The energy of the Dutch traders, however, repressed
in one direction, found vent in another. Dutch
fleets overcame the Spanish naval forces in the Pacific
and transferred to the Dutch the control of many of the
Spanish possessions in the East, while the trade between
the Mediterranean and the North of Europe was largely
transferred from Venice and Genoa to Amsterdam and
Harlem. The devastation that had been brought upon
Antwerp during the struggle with Spain, and the migration
to the provinces of the North of thousands of the
Protestants who had constituted a very important portion
of the more intelligent and enterprising of the inhabitants
of Flanders and Brabant, had helped to develop in the
cities of the Dutch Republic the industries and the commerce
of which Antwerp and Bruges had so long been
the centre.</p>

<p>While for a large part of Europe the Thirty Years’
War meant a throttling, or at least a serious hampering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
of its trade, the commerce of the Dutch flourished behind
the guns of their fighting vessels. With the expansion
of the ambition and of the material resources of the new
nation, came a rapid development of its intellectual activities
and of the productive work of its scholars and
writers.</p>

<p>The Elzevirs had (as would naturally be the case with
men who were exiles on the ground of their faith) associated
themselves with the stricter and more earnest of
the Calvinists of their adopted country. Bonaventure,
the youngest of the sons of the first Louis, makes various
references in his correspondence to the acceptance of and
his cordial sympathy with the creed of the Calvinists as
formulated by the Synod of Dort. The first publication
which bore his individual imprint was a work of religious
controversy bearing the rather ponderous title, <i>Censura
ne Confessionem sive Declarationem Sententiæ eorum qui
in Fœderato Belgio remonstrantes vocantur, super Præcipues
Articules Christianæ Religionis, A. SS. Theol. Professoribus
Academiæ Leidensis Instituta. 1626. Cum
Privilegio.</i></p>

<p>Bonaventure married the daughter of a zealous Calvinist
preacher, and he himself remained until his death an
important lay member of the Council of the Ancients of
the Walloon Church, a council which was charged not
only with the government of the Church itself, but with
a large measure of responsibility in connection with both
the spiritual and the civil administration of the community.</p>

<p>The intellectual ferment of which the bitter theological
controversies that raged about the name and the doctrines
of Arminius were an evidence (or a result), stimulated
the production of books and furthered the habit of
reading among many classes of the people to whom
printed matter had previously been comparatively unfamiliar.
The period immediately succeeding the Synod<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
of Dort witnessed an enormous increase in the list of
publications by Dutch writers. The views of the Remonstrants
and of their opponents the Contra-Remonstrants
on the famous five points of predestination,
redemption, depravity, conversion, and perseverance,
required for their adequate setting forth a long series
both of folios and of pamphlets. On these and other
grounds, the year 1618 proved to be an exceptionally
favourable period for the beginning of a great publishing
concern, and the two Elzevirs showed themselves fully
capable of taking advantage effectively of the opportunity.
The printing-office in Leyden appears to have been completely
organised early in the year 1618. Its first immediate
director was Isaac, the grandson of Louis. In 1625,
he retired from the concern, leaving both the printing and
the publishing business in the hands of his uncle Bonaventure
and his brother Abraham. The year 1626 is
considered by Willems to have marked the most brilliant
period in the long record of the House, although in later
years a longer series of important works was produced.
The productions of the Elzevir Press during the next two
or three years were in part devoted to the theology of the
period (such as the acts of the National Synod), but were
principally represented by the great editions of the classics
for which the Elzevir imprint will always remain
famous.</p>

<p>In 1625, the Elzevirs took over the printing-office of
Erpenius, who was at the time the only printer in the
Netherlands, and one of the few in Europe, who possessed
any Oriental fonts. In 1629, they initiated with
<i>Horace</i> and <i>Ovid</i> the series of Latin classics in sixteenmo,
a form which followed very fairly the proportions of the
famous series of Aldus. In 1641, they began, with the
issue of <i>The Cid</i>, a series of contemporary French drama,
and in 1642, with the works of Regnier, a series of the
chief monuments of French literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span></p>

<p>Bonaventure and Abraham died in the same year,
1652, but their sons, John and Daniel, were already of
sufficient age and of sufficient training to assume the
direction of affairs. Among the earlier of the works
issued by these two, were an edition of the <i>Imitation
of Christ</i> and one of the <i>Psalms</i>, which are described
by the enthusiastic Willems as “jewels of typography.”
In 1655, Daniel transferred himself to Amsterdam,
where he was associated with his cousin Louis. John’s
death came a year or two later, leaving in Leyden
no member of the Elzevir family. John’s widow,
Eva van Alphen, thereupon made herself the head
of the printing and publishing concern, and was able
also to retain control of the business of the University.
The activity of the publishing lessened during
the following few years, but the excellence of the work
turned out by the printing-office seems not materially
to have suffered, and a number of the more important
publications issued with the imprint of the Elzevir firm
in Amsterdam, were manufactured in the Press of the
Elzevir widow in Leyden. After the death of Eva, in
1681, there was, however, a rapid deterioration not only
in the activity of the publishing, but in the work turned
out by the printing-office. Her son Abraham appears to
have been both ignorant and incapable. His business
was before long limited to the printing of the University
theses, and there were at the time not a few complaints
from the instructors concerning the badness of the work
put into these. Abraham’s death occurred in 1712, and
it seems probable that even if he had had a longer life,
the work of the printing-office would speedily have come
to a close from inanition or from lack of intelligent direction.</p>

<p>The plant and material of the once famous printing-office
was sold at auction, in 1713, for the benefit
of the creditors and of a daughter left by Abraham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
For nearly a century the printing of the University had
been in the hands of the Elzevir family, but after the
migration in 1665, of Louis to Amsterdam, the more
important of the publishing undertakings of the Elzevirs
bear the imprint of the Amsterdam House. The first
printer to the University had been William Silvius, who
had, before coming to Leyden, held in Antwerp the title
of Printer to the King. Silvius was a scholar as well as
a printer, and having given evidence of sympathy with
the Protestant group, he found it desirable to get away
from Antwerp. He held the post in Leyden for but a
few months, dying in 1580. For nearly four years, the
University appears to have dispensed with the services
of a University printer and publisher, but in 1584, the
position was given to Christophe Plantin, the famous
Antwerp publisher, who was at the time, in connection
with certain difficulties, an exile from his home city. It
is probable from his acceptance of the post and from the
labour given by him to the organisation of an effective
printing establishment, that Plantin had seriously in view
at the time the plan of a permanent transfer to Leyden
of his business interests. In 1585, however, his difficulties
having been adjusted, Plantin found it practicable to
return to Antwerp, but he was able, in leaving Leyden, to
secure from the University authorities the appointment
as his successor of his son-in-law Raphelengius. The
latter added to his duties as a printer the professorship
of Hebrew in the University, and it is evident from the
record that he was more assiduous in his work as an instructor
than in attention to the rather complex responsibilities
of the University printing-office. On the death
of Raphelengius, in 1597, the post was given to his son
Christopher, who survived his father, however, but for
four years. The successor of the younger Raphelengius
was a certain Johannes Patius (Jean Paedts). His work
appears to have been unsatisfactory, and, in 1620, Isaac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Elzevir, grandson of Louis, came into direction of the
University printing.</p>

<p>The annual compensation given to Silvius and, later,
to Plantin, was two hundred florins. Under the agreement
with Isaac Elzevir, the money payment was fixed
at fifty florins. It seems probable, however, that during
the thirty-five years that had passed since the first establishment
of the office, there had been a sufficient development
in the incidental business connected with the
University printing and publishing to render the post
more valuable in 1620 with a stipend of fifty florins, than
it had been in 1585 with a payment of two hundred.</p>

<p>The agreement with Isaac Elzevir provided that he
should hold at the disposition of members of the University
Faculty one press and during certain seasons of
the year two presses, the work of which was apparently
devoted to the <i>précis</i> or papers of instruction recognised
for use in the class-room. The productions of more
considerable compass of which the professors were the
authors, were passed upon by the curators of the Press
and by the senate of the University with reference to
their publication through the University Press and at the
charge of the University treasury. The printer was
under obligations to secure for the Press the service of
correctors competent to supervise the text of any language
required. In the majority of cases there should,
of course, have been no difficulty in securing such correctors
from the membership of the University itself.
Any illustrations to be included in the University publications
were to be “supplied to the printer,” but it is
not clear whether this provision implies that the authors
of books, the remaining expense of which was provided
by the University, must themselves meet the outlay for
the production of the illustrations.</p>

<p>One copy of every work printed by the Publisher to
the University was to be deposited in the University<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
library. The publishing undertakings were, in the matter
of Press censorship or supervision, to be subject to the
regulations of the States-General. What censorship was
put in force appears, however, to have been exercised
through certain selected members of the Theological
Faculty of the University. I find no reference to any
political questions arising in connection with these Leyden
publications, and apparently there was, outside of
the theologians, no keen interest in censorship or in Press
supervision. The privilege of occupying for the printing-office
a portion of the court or quadrangle of the University
buildings, was doubtless estimated as a portion of
the compensation and must have been of material service
for the prestige of the concern, irrespective of the detail
of the saving of rent.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to a certain Erpenius (Th.
van Erpen), whose Oriental fonts were taken over, later,
by the Elzevirs. Erpenius was one of the more noteworthy
scholars who brought prestige to the Faculty of
the University. Not content with the task of giving
instruction in the languages and literatures of the Orient,
or possibly influenced by the difficulty of carrying on
such instruction without an adequate supply of texts,
Erpenius set up a printing-office in his own house and
undertook at his own cost the production of a series of
the works of representative Eastern writers. His death,
at the early age of forty, interrupted the scholarly undertaking.
His widow had had in view the sale to some
printers in Paris of the costly collection of type moulds
and punches, which constituted, in fact, almost the entire
property that had been left to her. The University
authorities were averse to permitting this collection to go
out of the country, but there happened to be at the time
no funds in the treasury adequate to give to the widow
the sum she had been offered from Paris. Isaac Elzevir
himself provided the amount required, and purchased the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
material in his own name. It was transferred to his successors,
but when the University confirmed them as the
official printers, it was made a condition that this Oriental
material should be retained in Leyden at the disposition
of the University. The annual compensation was
at the same time raised to one hundred florins. There
was a further specification in the agreement to the effect
that any books required by the professors or <i>notabilités
académiques</i>, the University publisher was to procure
(from Frankfort or Paris) “at his own risk or peril,” and
was to charge for the same no higher price than was to
be charged by other booksellers. In 1631, the annual
stipend was increased to three hundred florins, “in consideration
of the exceptional outlays required by the Oriental
work of the printing-office and of the cost of
providing a special corrector for the Oriental works.”</p>

<p>Up to the time of the death of Abraham, the last
member of the Leyden family, no further changes of importance
occurred in the relations between the University
and its Press. In a number of respects the general organisation
and regulation of the Leyden University Press
appear to have been quite similar to the arrangement
which was put into force, in 1632, in Oxford at the
institution of the Clarendon Press.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It is, of course,
probable enough that the history of the University of
Leyden was well known in Oxford and that the regulations
controlling the Leyden Press may have served, if
not as a model, at least as a general suggestion for the
scheme of the organisation of the Clarendon Press.</p>

<p>The number of theses printed by the University printer
increased steadily, the increase being an indication, in
part, of the growth of the University, and, in part, of
the development of the literary activities of its members.
The summary of the theses is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>
<table>
<tr><td>1654, printed by John and Daniel Elzevir</td>       <td class="tdr">2</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The cost of the several buildings erected for the work
of the printers was borne by the Elzevirs. These buildings
all stood, however, upon land owned by the University,
and were, in fact, immediately connected with
the buildings of instruction. The printing-offices remained,
therefore, the property of the University, doubtless
under the usual conditions of a ground lease. In
August, 1641, John Evelyn, writing from Leyden, speaks
of visiting the famous Heinsius, and also of inspecting
the famous book-shop and the printing-office of the Elzevirs,
“renowned throughout Europe for the importance
of their publications and for the beauty of their typography.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
Evelyn goes on to speak of a statue carved
in stone which stood opposite the gateway of the printing-office
enclosure, a “representation of the fortunate monk
who, as is claimed by the Hollanders, was the first inventor
of printing, an opinion combated by the Germans,
who insist that the glory of the invention belongs
to Gutenberg.” It is not quite certain that the printing-office
enclosure or the University court did include at
this time a statue of Koster. There was, however, such
a statue in the city, in the <i>Haarlemmerstraat</i>, and the
English tourist may either have confused his memory as
to the location of this, or possibly have thought himself
justified, for the sake of dramatic effect, in placing the
statue where, according to his judgment, it properly
belonged, in front of the headquarters of the printing
interests in Holland.</p>

<p>The work of the Elzevirs in Leyden had continued
from 1621 to 1712, a period of ninety-one years. The
printing and publishing House instituted by the Elzevirs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>in The Hague began its operations in 1590. Its first
head was Louis, the second son of the founder of the
dynasty. His work was, however, limited to the business
of bookselling, his establishment containing one of
the most comprehensive and best organised collections of
scholarly publications to be found in the North of Europe.
After his death, in 1621, the business was carried
on for about twenty years, first by his brother Bonaventure
and, later, by his nephews and their cousins. In
1661, the book-shop at The Hague was finally closed, the
stock being, in part, transferred to Amsterdam, and in
part, sold at auction.</p>

<p>The continuity of the printing and publishing work
originated in Leyden, was maintained by the branch of
the Elzevir family which settled at Amsterdam, and the
Amsterdam House continued active operations until
about the close of the seventeenth century. The book-shop
in Amsterdam was instituted in 1638, by Louis,
grandson of Louis of Louvain. In 1640, Louis added to
his book-shop the plant of a printing-office, and when, in
1655, he obtained the coöperation of his cousin Daniel
from Leyden, the Amsterdam House was able to secure
for itself a foundation and a prestige which exceeded that
of the parent concern in Leyden. In fact the series of
publications issued from Amsterdam during the twenty
years following 1655 was more considerable and important
than the list of the Leyden Elzevirs during the
same period. It is proper to add, however, that even for
the books of this period the experts give the palm for
typographical excellence to the volumes bearing the Leyden
imprint. The most noteworthy of the publications of
the first ten years of the new partnership, from the point
of view at least of typographical excellence, were the
<i>Corpus Juris</i>, published in folio in 1663, and the French
text of the Scriptures edited by Desmarets, issued in
1669.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span></p>

<p>Louis retired in 1665, and on the death of Daniel, in
1680, there being no sons old enough to carry on the
concern and no cousins available, the business was wound
up. The last publication bearing the imprint of Elzevir
of Amsterdam was issued in 1680, by Anna, the widow
of Daniel. The emblem of the Elzevirs, which appeared
on the signs of the several buildings occupied by them in
Amsterdam, was an elm. An important feature in the
rapid development of the publishing business of the Elzevirs,
a feature which may be considered partly as cause
and partly as effect, was the extensive series of foreign
connections, connections initiated by the first Louis, and
maintained and extended by two generations of his successors.
The majority of the Dutch publishers of the
time were content to limit their trade connections to the
towns of their own country, with an occasional correspondent
in Frankfort. But Louis Elzevir, with a larger
ambition and a more comprehensive view of the requirements
of a high-grade publishing business, decided from
the outset that the widest possible connections with the
scholarly book-buyers of Europe was essential in order to
ensure adequate support for the class of undertakings he
had in view. Within fifteen years of the death of the
founder, the firm had a direct representation in nearly
every one of the book-selling centres of Europe. A number
of these agencies were placed, either temporarily or
permanently, in the charge of some member of the family,
and it became the usual routine for the younger Elzevirs
to secure in turn in this manner an important part of
their education and their business training, in different
foreign cities. The fact that during nearly a century the
family circle was so large, facilitated not a little the carrying
out of a general scheme of a federation of book-selling
agencies, whose special purpose it was to make
known to the reading public of Europe, and to find an
outlet for the productions of the Elzevir Presses. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
first Louis was able, notwithstanding his active labours
in Leyden, to pass a considerable portion of each year on
the trade routes of Germany and France. His youngest
son, Bonaventure, had, before his twenty-third year,
sojourned in all the more important of the cities of Italy,
and the nephews and grandchildren appear to have, so to
speak, parcelled out Europe between them, carrying on
literary campaigns from Naples in the South, to Copenhagen
in the North. These “campaigns” had for their
purpose not only the distribution of the Elzevir publications,
but the collection from literary centres throughout
Europe of “copy,” “texts,” and literary suggestions, to
utilise for future publishing undertakings. The travelling
Elzevirs were also, of course, in a position to secure to
advantage the supplies required for their retail concerns
in Leyden, Amsterdam, and The Hague. Willems finds
records of large purchases of books made by the Elzevirs
in Italy between 1606 and 1652. In 1622, there are references
showing the existence in Venice of a depot for
the sale of the Elzevir publications, and it appears that
this depot was within a stone’s throw of the site of the
establishment of Aldus, closed nearly half a century
earlier. It was the Aldine classics that served as a model
or at least as a suggestion for the more beautiful and
more accurate sixteenmo editions of Elzevir. There was
also an agency in Florence which, in the seventeenth
century, was more nearly than Venice the literary centre
of Italy.</p>

<p>Even at this time, 1675-1700, there was no organised
system of transportation between Holland and Italy that
could be depended upon for regular shipments of books.
There is a reference in the Elzevir correspondence in
1675, and again in 1679, to the forwarding of bales of
books through the kindness of travellers, in the former
instance through Charles Dati,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and in the latter through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>the Abbé Brassetti. <i>De exemplaren von Virgilius sign
door schipper Jan Willis op Livorno versonden ende geaddresseert
aen Abbate Brassetti, soo dat met twyffele ofte
sullen wel te recht koomen.</i><a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>With England the Elzevirs had important relations,
not only in the matter of buying and selling books, but
in connection with the publication of a considerable
number of books by English authors. Some of these
publications were undertaken either for the account of
the authors or of English publishers, who desired to
secure the advantage of the Elzevir typography, which
could not at that time be equalled by the work of any
printers in England. It was the England of Charles II.,
of Pepys, Evelyn, Dryden, and Baxter, of which we are
speaking.</p>

<p>In Frankfort the Elzevirs instituted, as early as 1595,
a permanent depot for their publications, utilising their
agency also for the collection of stock for the retail departments
both of the Leyden and of the Amsterdam
House. The first general catalogue of the books offered
at the Frankfort Fair was printed in 1564, by George
Willer, a bookseller of Augsburg. After 1595, these
semi-annual Fair catalogues always contained an important
representation of the Elzevir publications. The semi-annual
gatherings of the booksellers at Frankfort were
maintained, at least in form, during the stormy period of
the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648), although at certain
of the appointed dates the attendance was very small and
the business done but trifling. The records of the Fair
give evidence, however, that notwithstanding the serious
difficulties and dangers of travel during this period, a representative
of the Elzevirs made his way from Holland
and was recorded as present at every one of the Fairs
during the thirty years. From the middle of the seventeenth
century, the Frankfort Fair decreased in importance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>the centre of the book-trade of Germany being
transferred to Leipzig. For a number of years the Fair
was held in both places, but before 1700 its business was
transferred entirely to Leipzig, which became the headquarters
of the book-trade in Germany, the best organised
book-trade in Europe. The change was brought about
through a variety of influences. The operations and
results of the Thirty Years’ War had doubtless something
to do with the matter, but it is possible that a large factor
was the increasing intellectual activity of the Protestant
States of North Germany as compared with that of
the territory, in the main Catholic, of the South. Leipzig
was of course better situated to serve as a centre for
book production and for book distribution for these
Northern States. It lacked, however, the very important
advantage which had so long furthered the trade of
Frankfort, the convenience, namely, of direct connection
by water (the river Main) with the great highway of the
Continent, the Rhine. For the traders from Holland,
the Rhine was the natural means of communication with
Germany, and made easy an important portion of the
route to Italy. For this and for other reasons, the Elzevirs
opposed the removal of the Fair from Frankfort to
Leipzig, and their influence was sufficiently powerful to
delay this removal for a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>The Elzevirs retained in their hands for many years a
very large proportion of the business of supplying Germany
with foreign publications, including more particularly
those from Holland, England, and France. The
German booksellers of this period appear to have been
comparatively unenterprising in the matter of maintaining
direct foreign connections. With Paris, the energetic
Louis had taken pains to open relations almost at the
outset of his business career. Reference is made as early
as 1602 to a sojourn by Louis in Paris, and to a privilege
extended to him for a term of three weeks of accepting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
orders for his books from the Paris dealers. Under the
regulations which had been established for the French
book-trade, regulations emanating in part from the University
that had from an early period assumed the right
to control bookselling, and in part from the Booksellers’
Guild itself, foreign dealers could do business in Paris
only under a very narrow system of restrictions. They
were forbidden either to buy or to sell at the Fairs of St.
Germain and St. Laurent; they were forbidden to come
to Paris more frequently than once a year, or to sojourn
there for a longer period than three weeks, counting from
the date of the opening of their bales; they were, further,
forbidden to accept orders from any but the booksellers
of the Guild (<i>les libraires jurés</i>). Bonaventure,
the son of Louis, appears to have made, after 1624, regular
annual sojourns in Paris. In 1626, he brought back
with him to Leyden a series of unpublished letters of the
scholar Scaliger, who had died in Leyden seventeen years
before. Scaliger had held in Leyden the Chair of Belles-Lettres,
and had done much to add to the prestige of the
University. Among his pupils was Grotius. The list of
the Leyden publications gives evidence that these Paris
visits were utilised for the collection of material from
French authors and editors. Against this kind of competition
on the part of foreign publishers the French
book-trade was evidently unable to frame any effective
regulations.</p>

<p>One of the most distinctive of the Elzevir undertakings
in foreign parts was the branch House established in 1632
in Copenhagen. The Danish community proved to be a
good customer as well for the publications from Holland
as for the books which the Elzevirs were able to supply
to advantage from Germany, Italy, and France. One
evidence of the importance attached by the Elzevirs to
this branch House in Copenhagen was the printing (in
1642) of a separate catalogue of the books there offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
for sale. The first of the Elzevirs to visit Denmark was
probably Louis (the second) in 1632. There are references
to later visits by him in 1634, and in 1637. On
the occasion of his first visit, he had opened a shop and
appointed a permanent representative. The record of
the town library of Copenhagen contains an entry of the
payment to Elzevir, in 1632, of two hundred and sixty-four
<i>rigsdaler</i> for books imported, and of a further payment,
in 1634, of one hundred and twenty <i>rigsdaler</i>.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>In 1650, it was Daniel who represented the House in
the North, sojourning in both Sweden and Denmark, and
having for his travelling companion one of his famous
authors, Nicholas Heinsius. While Daniel Elzevir was
in Sweden, he received a proposition from Queen Christina
to establish a printing and publishing concern in
Stockholm. Christina of Sweden was a daughter of
Gustavus Adolphus. She was at the time but twenty-eight
years of age, but she had already given evidence of
a strength of character and a brilliancy of intellect that
made her personality a very distinctive one. She was a
scholar of varied attainments and a great collector of
books, and she was ambitious to make her capital city a
literary centre for the North of Europe. Mr. Myrop
speaks of the proposition made to Elzevir as being a very
flattering one, and it is easy to understand that the ambitious
Queen could hope to secure in her literary undertakings
the kind of service she required from a House
like the Elzevirs, who were alike the greatest publishers,
the most distinguished printers, and the most extensive
booksellers of their time. For some reason, however,
the suggestion of a Stockholm branch did not happen to
fit in with the policy of the House, and the proposition
was declined.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> A few years later, a printing and publishing
concern was established in Stockholm, under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>protection of King Charles Gustavus, by Johann Janssons
of Amsterdam. The visit to Stockholm of Daniel Elzevir
and his negotiations with Christina preceded by but four
years the abdication of the brilliant but erratic Queen,
which took place in 1654. She became a Catholic (her
intention of abandoning Protestantism was one ground
for her abdication) and made her home in Rome. She
brought with her to Rome no less than 2145 books in
manuscript, and after becoming a Roman citizen, she
added to the collection several hundred valuable works.
With a few exceptions, the entire collection now rests in
the Vatican.</p>

<p>The most valuable of the books she had owned in
Stockholm was the famous <i>Codex Argenteus</i>, which contains
a portion of the Gospels in the Merso-Gothic version
of Ulfilas. This <i>Codex</i> the Queen had, however,
given away, before her abdication, to a certain Count
Magnus de la Gardie, and it remained in Sweden, where
it is still preserved as one of the greatest treasures of the
State. Among the more important of the literary antiquities
that the Queen had taken with her to Rome,
were the codices of the <i>Septuagint</i>, written in the seventh
century, several manuscripts dating from the Carlovingian
times, a very old <i>Psalter</i>, and a copy of the Theodosian
Code and the Laws of the Visigoths, which was
said to have been written in the middle of the seventh
century. There is also a fragment of the Theodosian
Code, written in the Tironian character. In addition to
this great series of manuscripts, the Queen left nearly six
thousand printed books, an enormous library for a collection
made as early as the middle of the seventeenth century.
She died in 1689.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The many who have admired the typographical <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i>
which issued from the presses of the Elzevirs,
neglect to give due credit to the name of the man to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>whose artistic skill is to be credited the designing and
engraving of the punches from which were produced the
exquisite Elzevir fonts of type. It is the general opinion
of typographical experts that these fonts, in the beauty
of their proportion, the delicacy of their outline, and the
distinctive grace of their general effect, surpassed anything
that had as yet been produced in Europe. The
discovery that the designer of these fonts was Christophe
Van Dyck is due to the researches of Willems. Van
Dyck’s work appears to have been done between the
years 1630 and 1640. The name is a famous one in the
annals of the Netherlands, but there is, I understand,
nothing to show that this artistic engraver and type-founder
was connected with Sir Anthony Van Dyck, the
Flemish painter. The latter was born in 1599, and died
(in England) in 1641, so that the two men were, however,
contemporaries.</p>

<p>During the larger portion of time in which the presses
of the Elzevirs were active, the publishers had the advantage
of carrying on their work under comparatively slight
restrictions in the matter of government censorship, while
to censorship on the part of the Church there are but few
references. It is probable that during the seventeenth century
the Press of the Dutch Republic was more untrammelled
than that of any State in Europe. It is true that
there is record of various edicts and regulations on the part
of the States-General prohibiting the printing of libellous
material, or of works directed against princes or governments
which were allied with the Republic. There is also
an occasional edict against the circulation of publications
classed as “irreligious” or “obscene.” With the latter
class of publications the Elzevirs took no part either as
printers or as booksellers. It did occasionally happen,
however, that they interested themselves in the production
and in the circulation of publications, the purpose or
influence of which might evoke criticisms or complaints<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
from friendly governments or from individual statesmen.
For such publications they found it wise to make use of
some <i>nom de presse</i> or to issue the same without imprint
of name or place. Such publications can be identified as
coming from the Elzevirs either by means of books of
account or through the evidence of their very distinctive
fonts of type.</p>

<p>Among the books for the anonymous circulation of
which the House was responsible, were the <i>Defensio
Regia</i> of Saumaise, the <i>Defensio Populi Anglicani</i> of Milton,
and the <i>Mare Clausum</i> of Selden. The interest of
the Elzevirs in circulating the last named treatise (which
was an argument to justify certain pretensions of England)
is somewhat to be wondered at, because, only
shortly before, they had published with their imprint the
famous argument of Grotius, <i>Mare Liberum</i>, in which
was upheld the Dutch contention in behalf of the freedom
of the seas.</p>

<p>On a number of the unavowed publications of this kind,
the Elzevirs placed the imprint <i>Lugduni</i> (Lyons), in place
of <i>Lugduni Batavorum</i> (Leyden). This was done particularly
in the case of the writings of the French Jansenists,
who would not wish to emphasise the fact that
these were printed in such an heretical headquarters as
Leyden. One of the bogus names employed quite frequently
for these unavowed publications was that of
Jouxte, and another was Jean Sambix. The imprint of
Nic Schouten, Köln, was also utilised, together with a
number of mythical or manufactured names connected
with actual places.</p>

<p>The Elzevirs, following the example set a century and
a half earlier by Aldus, but since that time very generally
lost sight of by the later publishers, initiated a number
of series of books in small and convenient forms, twelvemo
and sixteenmo, which were offered to book-buyers at
prices considerably lower than those they had been in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
habit of paying for similar material printed in folio, quarto,
or octavo. For volumes of classics printed in twelvemo,
such as the <i>Virgil</i> of 1636, the <i>Pliny</i> of 1640, and the
<i>Cicero</i> of 1642, volumes containing an average of five
hundred pages, the catalogue price was one florin, the
equivalent in currency of about forty-three cents. <i>Quintus
Curtius</i>, published in 1633, is catalogued at sixteen
sous, the equivalent of thirty-five cents. <i>Sallust</i>, <i>Terence</i>,
and <i>Florus</i>, sold at fifteen sous; and <i>Livy</i>, in three volumes,
at four florins ten sous.</p>

<p>These well edited, carefully printed, and low priced
editions of the classics won for the Elzevirs the cordial
appreciation of scholars and of students throughout Europe.
Matthew Berneggerus, professor of Strasburg, in
the preface to his translation of Galileo’s <i>System of the
Universe</i>, speaks of the Elzevirs as unquestionably the
first typographers of the world, <i>Elzevirios Leydenses typographus,
artis nobilissime facile princeps universio de
studiis præclare meritos</i>. The professor was writing in
1635, only six years after the appearance of the earliest
of the noteworthy specimens of the Elzevir typography,
which gives the impression that, notwithstanding all the
general obstacles and the special hindrances of war times,
the diffusion of information concerning new publications,
at least in the university centres, must have been fairly
prompt. A few years later, Galileo (who died in 1642)
himself gave testimony to the excellence of the work
done by his Dutch publishers.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> I do not find record of
the arrangements entered into by Galileo for the publication
of the translation of his treatise, but it is evident that
he considered the undertaking a desirable one. The approval
on the part of the scholars of these smaller and
more economical editions of the Elzevirs was, however,
not unanimous. The scholar, De Put (Erycius Puteanus),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>writing to Heinsius, in 1629, to acknowledge the receipt
of the new <i>Horace</i>, says: “The Elzevirs are certainly
great typographers. I can but think, however, that their
reputation will suffer in connection with these trifling
little volumes with such slender type. An author like
Horace deserves to be produced in a dignified form,
with a certain majesty of appearance, and not to have
his thoughts buried in shabby little type like this.” It
was not unnatural that the long-time association of great
authors with big volumes should have brought about
the impression, not easily to be outgrown, that the
size of the book should be in direct proportion to
the literary importance of its contents. This view of
the requirements and limitations of book-making was,
however, based on the assumption that books were for
the use of the wealthier classes only, or for placing in
libraries which were accessible only to privileged bodies
of scholars. The tendency of the age was, on the other
hand, towards a continually increasing distribution of
literature among impecunious scholars and with the public
at large; and the Elzevirs, while doubtless shaping
their publishing plans with a view to securing the largest
business returns, were also, in popularising the best literature,
doing their part towards the spread of the higher
education of the community.</p>

<p>Some authors of their time were, in fact, so fully appreciative
of the service rendered to their fame by the
circulation of their writings in the attractive form given
to them by the Elzevirs, that in place of considering the
appropriation of their productions as a grievance, they
were ready to express their satisfaction at the compliment
thus paid to them. In 1648, the Elzevirs printed an unauthorised
edition of <i>Les Lettres Choisies</i> of Balzac (Jean
Louis Guez), putting on the title-page, according to their
usual routine for “appropriated” books, the words
<i>Suivant la copie imprimée à Paris</i>. So far was the author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
from feeling any annoyance at this proceeding, that he
promptly wrote to express his gratification, and to suggest
that the Elzevirs might also be interested in publishing
in the same form an edition of his <i>Œuvres Diverses</i>.
A further correspondence followed, and finally the Elzevirs
received from Balzac (some time in 1651) a letter of
which the following is the substance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noin">
“<span class="smcap">To the Elzevirs</span>,</p>

<p>Publishers and Printers of Leyden.</p>
<p class="noin">
<i>Gentlemen</i>: 
</p>

<p>I am under larger obligations to you than you may
yourselves fully realise. I consider the right of Roman
citizenship to be a small privilege compared with that
which you have conferred upon me in including my name
in the list of your authors. This is to give me rank with
the consuls and senators of Rome; I am made an associate
of the Ciceros and the Sallusts. What glory comes
to me when I can say ‘I am a citizen of the Republic of
Immortals; I have been received into the circle of the
demi-gods.’ In the literary palace of Leyden we have
in fact all been made sojourners under the same roof.
Thanks to your efforts, I find myself at one moment
opposite Pliny, at the next by the side of Seneca, or a
little later placed with Tacitus and Livy; and although I
may myself occupy but an inconsiderable place, I have at
least the satisfaction of making part of a great company, a
company of which Homer himself is the patriarch....
For them, as for myself, the repute has been extended
by the skill and judgment of the typographical artist.
For some architects reputation has come through the
construction of pyramids and colossi, while others have
gained no less fame through the art put into rings and
seals.... The excellence of work depends not
upon its extent but upon its appropriateness and perfection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
I am therefore well pleased for my part that in
place of putting me into folio, you have printed my
productions in these exquisite little volumes.... I
subscribe myself</p>

<p class="center">
Your obliged servant,</p>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Balzac</span>.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>The letter is worth quoting if only to indicate the
different point of view of the author of the seventeenth
century and of him of the nineteenth. The letters written,
prior to the Convention of Berne, by the Parisian authors
of the present time concerning the books which the publishers
of the Low Countries had done them the honour
of reprinting, are expressed in a very different manner.</p>

<p>In 1663, Daniel Elzevir had consented (this is the
phrase used in the correspondence) to reprint a collection
of the poetry of Ménage. The poet was so well pleased
to have secured the imprint of the great publisher of
Europe, that he took pains to insert in the volume an
introduction in Latin verse to express his gratification.
The lines begin somewhat as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ye gods and goddesses what do I behold!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My verse presented in the type of the Elzevirs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh type graceful and exquisite!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh volume charming and artistic!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">

<hr class="tb"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But thou, Elzevir, my sweet glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou the father of this type without rival,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me, honoured friend, what I can offer thee in exchange for this honour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May the friends of literature ever gather about thy House;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May the crowd of buyers of books ever press forwards towards thy book-shops;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May the name of Elzevir, transmitted by the voice of his poets from century to century, be heard through the entire earth and rise to the heavens themselves;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
May the fame of the Elzevirs eclipse that of the Turnèbes and the Vascosans and rise superior even to the renown of the Estiennes and of Aldus!”</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the time when Ménage was expressing in florid
eloquence his gratification at being accepted as an Elzevir
author, the new typographical form had finally established
itself against all criticism. A large proportion of the
publishers, not only of the Netherlands, but also of Paris
and of Florence, had adopted the Elzevir model, and the
folios and quartos which had characterised the first two
centuries of printing were put to one side as representing
the literature of the middle ages. The earlier forms of
printed volumes, at least in the divisions of classics and
theology, were preserved to a later date in England than
on the Continent.</p>

<p>As was necessarily the case with a firm acting as printers
for the University and whose publications included
so long a list of scholarly works, the Elzevirs had associated
with their publishing office a group of scholarly
editors and press-revisers. Apart also from the men who
were directly in their employ or with whom they had arranged
for editorial service, they enjoyed the benefit of
the suggestions and the counsel of a number of scholarly
friends and correspondents, without whose aid it would
in fact not have been practicable to initiate or to carry
on to a successful completion not a few of their important
undertakings. The adviser whose coöperation was most
important, and whose influence in directing the publishing
policy of the House was most considerable, was Daniel
Heinsius. After the year 1630, Heinsius acted as the
chief literary adviser of the House, and to his hand can
be traced a number of the dedicatory epistles, announcements,
and introductions which (written nearly always in
Latin) found place in a large number of the Elzevir
editions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span></p>

<p>Heinsius was a native of Ghent. He studied at Leyden,
where he was the favourite pupil, and, later, the
successor of the celebrated Scaliger. He filled in succession
the Chairs in the University, of Greek, of History,
and of Political Science. Later, he was placed in charge
of the library of the University, and served also as secretary
of the Academic Senate. He was so far accepted as
an authority on orthodox Calvinistic theology that he
was selected to be the secretary of the Synod of Dort.
He possessed the faculty, not very common with a man
of scholarship, of writing and speaking gracefully not only
in Latin, the literary language of the time, but also in his
mother tongue. The young publisher, Louis Elzevir,
while a man of ready intelligence and of rather varied
attainments, had never had the leisure or the opportunity
for scholarship. He may well, therefore, have considered
himself fortunate in being able to secure at the outset of
his ambitious publishing schemes the coöperation of a man
like Heinsius, and it is not surprising that the influence
of the professor became all-important in the direction
of the publishing business. In many ways this relation
was a fortunate one, but there were some offsetting considerations.
The scholars of the time appear to have
been not only a controversial but an irritable group, and
Heinsius possessed the <i>genus irritabile</i> to an exceptionable
degree. He succeeded in embroiling the firm with
a number of its scholarly friends and correspondents
whose influence and whose coöperation it was important
to retain. He was charged with having a special prejudice
against, or hate of the German scholars, even of
those who had associated themselves with Flemish or
Dutch institutions. Among the men of note in the
scholarly world who brought accusations against Heinsius
for bad treatment and for malice, and who contended that
the Elzevirs were seriously interfering with their relations
with the scholarly world in retaining as their adviser so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
bad tempered, so unreasonable and so malicious a person,
were Gebhardt, who held in the University of Groningen
the Chair of Greek, Grotius the well-known publicist,
Vossius, and, above all, Saumaise. The controversies
between Saumaise and Heinsius, controversies carried on
in part, so to speak, over the bodies of their publishers,
continued over a series of years, and might well have
formed the subject of a text in Disraeli’s <i>Amenities of
Literature</i>. Saumaise, or Salmasius, was by birth a
Frenchman, and his earlier university work was carried
on in Paris. He then became intimate with Casaubon,
through whose influence he became a Protestant. Later,
he studied at Heidelberg, and the years between 1632
and 1650 he was associated with the University of Leyden.
He then, at the instance of Queen Christina,
passed some years in Sweden. Famous in various departments
of learning, he was probably the chief authority
of his time on philology. At the request of Charles
II., at the time an exile in Holland, Saumaise wrote, in
1649, his <i>Defensio Regia pro Carolo I.</i>, which brought
forth the more famous <i>Defensio pro Populo Anglicano</i> of
Milton. Hallam says that “what Saumaise did not
know was considered to be beyond the bounds of knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Notwithstanding some frictions caused by the
antagonism of Daniel Heinsius, Saumaise remained a valued
friend to two generations of the Elzevirs, by whom
were issued editions of most of his works. The most
important of them was <i>Plinianæ Exercitationes in c. j.
Solini Polyhistoria</i>, published (by Bonaventure) in two
volumes in 1629, three years before the author’s arrival
in Leyden.</p>

<p>Bonaventure, whose control of the business had covered
the most noteworthy and prosperous years of the Leyden
House, died, as we have noted, in 1652. Among
the undertakings which were at the time in train and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>which were interrupted by his death, was a complete
edition, based upon the Vatican manuscripts, of the
Greek historian Procopius; a Latin version of the same,
to be prepared by Grotius; a complete edition of <i>Alemanus</i>,
edited by Holstenius; the complete works of Galileo,
in folio; the Latin epistles of Grotius; the works of Montaigne,
which were to follow Comines in the collection of
French classics; an edition of <i>Tacitus</i>, edited by Gronovius;
the Latin Dictionary of Calepino, as a companion
to the Greek Lexicon of Scapula; and, finally, a complete
and definitive edition of the <i>Corpus Juris</i>. This summary
of the undertakings that were in hand during the
month of Bonaventure’s death, gives an indication of the
activity of the House at the time, and of the direction of
its enterprises. The <i>Corpus Juris</i> was afterwards completed
by the Amsterdam firm.</p>

<p>The most famous of the authors whose works were
associated with the imprint of the second Louis, who was
the founder of the publishing establishment of Amsterdam,
were Descartes, Velthuysen, Wittichius, Coronius,
Vossius, and Grotius. The first complete edition of the
works of Descartes was issued in 1643, with the imprint
of Louis of Amsterdam. The new philosophy became at
once a cause of strife not only with the metaphysicians
but with the theologians. The partisans of Aristotle
made common cause with the ministers of the Reform
Church against the “Cartesian heresies.”</p>

<p>By the year 1655, the publishing undertakings of the
Amsterdam House exceeded in importance those issued
from Leyden. It is with this date that the presses of
Amsterdam begin to produce the series of Latin authors
in the twelvemo form of which Leyden heretofore held
the monopoly. It is also with this date that the Amsterdam
imprint finds place upon the works of Balzac, Barclay,
Charron, Du Refuye, etc. The most considerable
of the undertakings of Louis of Amsterdam, in respect at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
least to the risk incurred and the investment required,
was the French Bible of Desmarets, a work that had been
begun in 1664 and that was completed, in two folio volumes,
in 1669. This work was the culmination of the
publishing career of Louis, whose death occurred in the
year following its completion.</p>

<p>His successor in the management of the Amsterdam
House, his cousin Daniel, gave to the business a large
measure of skill, experience, judgment, and activity,
which appears to have been without break. Daniel’s first
experience as sole partner came in a time of difficulty.
The disastrous war with England during the years 1665-1667
interfered very seriously with the general prosperity
of the State, and caused special embarrassments to the
book-trade and publishing interests. This was the war
which resulted in the transfer to the English flag of the
colony of New Amsterdam, thereafter to be known as
New York. Daniel succeeded in weathering the storm,
and by the time of the Peace of Breda, he had been able,
with the aid of his editorial adviser Wetterus and of the
skilled typographer Wetstein, to place the business on
what seemed to be an assured foundation. One of his
correspondents of the time was the ingenious Nicholas
Thoynard, author of the <i>Harmony of the Gospels</i>. Thoynard
gave special study to the possibility of improving
the methods of printing, and, as early as 1680, put before
Elzevir a scheme for placing on the presses <i>formes solides</i>,
apparently the first suggestion of the modern stereotype
plates. Daniel dismissed the scheme as impracticable.
“To print two forms at one time,” he said, “is something
absolutely impossible to carry out, and it would in
any case be of no service.” Nicholas Heinsius (the son
of Daniel Heinsius), who had first been associated with
Daniel in Leyden, had, when the latter migrated to Amsterdam,
transferred his own literary interests and editorial
service to the Amsterdam House. The intimacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
of the two men continued through their lives, and they
died within a few months of each other.</p>

<p>The work of Heinsius as adviser for and business associate
with his publishing friend was interrupted by various
periods of public service, as he served as Ambassador both
in Sweden and in Russia, but on being relieved from
office, he always returned to his literary studies and to
his friend’s publishing-office. It is somewhat surprising
that the States-General should have favoured Heinsius
with posts of honour, as he appears to have been wanting
in public spirit, or at least in patriotic feeling. When, in
1674, the armies of Louis XIV. were carrying ruin and
devastation through the territory of Holland, Heinsius,
in a country retreat at Vianen (well out of the course of
the campaigning) was amusing his leisure in composing
verses in honour of the oppressor of his country, verses
which he utilised later as a dedication to his <i>Virgil</i>.
“The true country of Heinsius,” says his biographer,
“was imperial Rome, and in looking upon Louis XIV.
as Augustus, he thought of himself as a Horace or a
Virgil.”</p>

<p>The war with France, which continued for six years
(1672-1678), a war which brought with it all the horrors
of occupation of the country by invading armies, caused
almost a complete cessation of all business undertakings
and of all literary enterprises. The presses stopped work
and the book-shops were closed. The whole energy of
the people (excepting only in the case of an occasional
dilettante like Heinsius) was concentrated in the defence
of the country. Daniel Elzevir devoted a part of this
period of enforced idleness to the preparation of a classified
catalogue of his general stock, a catalogue more
extensive and more comprehensive than any heretofore
issued. Daniel died in 1680, in the midst of a long series
of unfinished undertakings and of literary plans. Graevius,
in sending the news to Heinsius, says, “This is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
great loss to letters.” The philosopher Locke writes,
“The death of Elzevir is a public misfortune.” Such
indeed was the universal feeling throughout the world of
letters and the community of scholars. With the death
of Daniel, the history of the House of Elzevir comes to
a close. Some printing of college theses was, in 1680,
still being done by Abraham in Leyden, but the work of
the great family, which had for nearly a century stood at
the head of the book-making and of the bookselling business
of Europe, occupying the first places alike among
typographers, publishers, and booksellers, was completed.
Daniel left no son, and the widow dying the year following,
the concern was wound up by the administrators.</p>

<p>The limits of this sketch will not permit even a summary
of the long list of books issued by the Elzevirs
during this century in which they were doing business as
publishers. It is only practicable to refer to the general
character of these publications and to point out that they
included the most considerable and comprehensive series
of important literature that had been associated with any
imprint since the invention of printing, while it is also in
order to remember that a very large proportion of the
volumes represented the highest development of the art
of typography. After two centuries of competition, the
country of Koster had, in the work of the printing-press,
unquestionably outclassed the country of Gutenberg and
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The publishing career of Louis Elzevir, the founder of
the House, continued from 1583 to 1617, a period of
thirty-four years. During this term he published a hundred
and one separate works. His first book, the work
which initiated the publishing undertakings of the Elzevirs,
bears the title:</p>

<p>With a few exceptions in Dutch and in French, the
works of Louis were printed in Latin.</p>

<p>The greater number bear on their title-page the words
<i>cum privilegio</i>. The privilege, when secured, was issued
by the States-General, and the usual term was from ten
to fifteen years. I find in the catalogue of titles no
specification (such as was at this time usual in France) of
an official censorship.</p>

<p>The association of Matthew, Bonaventure, and Abraham
Elzevir, who succeeded to the business of their
father Louis, and with whom was associated as the
printer to the concern their brother, Isaac Elzevir, continued
from 1617 to 1625. During these seven years,
they published one hundred and twenty-two separate

<p>Abraham Elzevir, with whose life was terminated the
record of the Leyden House, carried on the business for
thirty-one years, from 1681 to 1712, during which time
he printed but twenty-three works.</p>

<p>The last twenty years were devoted, as stated, entirely
to the printing of theses, the publishing business having
gradually been allowed to rust out.</p>

<p>His publications and printings included:</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">“Bibliotheca Heinsiana,” a catalogue of the collection of Nicholas
Heinsius.</li>

<li class="ifrst">Epictetus, the “Enchiridion” of, in Latin, and various Funeral Orations
and Memorial addresses on William III., of England, who died in 1702.</li>
</ul>

<p>Louis Elzevir, the second of the name, initiated, in
1638, the publishing business of the Amsterdam House,
which he conducted until 1655, when he was joined by
his cousin Daniel, from Leyden.</p>

<p>During these seventeen years he published one hundred
and eighty works. His first publication belonged
to a lighter class of literature than had previously been
associated with the Elzevir imprint. It bore the title:
<i>Dominici Baudii Amores, edente Petro Scriverio, inscripti.
Th. Graswinkelio, equiti.</i> 12mo. 1638. It comprised
a series of letters and views in which Baudius gives an
account of his various amorous misadventures. Willems
speaks of the work as originating in Holland, but I do
not understand that it could very well have been the
work of the Baudius who held the Chair of History in
Leyden up to 1613.</p>

<p>The widow of Daniel Elzevir (who survived him but a
year) was able to complete the printing of a few volumes
which had been left unfinished, but the publishing record
of the House was practically closed with the death of
Daniel in 1680.</p>

<p>The Elzevirs had carried on business as printers, publishers,
and booksellers, in their several Houses in Leyden,
Amsterdam, Utrecht, and The Hague, from 1583
to 1681, a period covering nearly a century. Their several
catalogues give the titles of 1608 separate works or
editions issued or printed by them during this time, an
average of about sixteen each year. It was naturally the
case, however, that the publications issued annually during
the later period very much exceeded those for which
the founder of the House was responsible.</p>

<p>A very large proportion, and, as the years went by, an
increasing proportion of the publications of each year
consisted of new editions of the earlier issues of the
House, but it is to be borne in mind that while, as a rule,
these reissues did not call for further publishing initiative
or editorial labour they did require an entire resetting of
the type, and, therefore, involved a repetition (except
perhaps as to the item of illustrations) of the first publishing
outlay. The invention of stereotyping and electro-typing,
by means of which the form of type once set can
be cast, and the plates preserved for use in printing further
editions, belongs to a later century. The process of
stereotyping was probably first perfected in Paris in 1795,
by Firmin Didot.</p>

<p>The categories and bibliographies from which I have
cited the preceding statistics include not only the books
printed and published by the Elzevirs, but the more important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
of the works which were printed by them for the
account of other publishers, and which were, therefore, not
issued with their publishing imprint. In the majority of
instances, however, the Elzevirs retained, in their hands
as booksellers, the agencies for the sale of these books
for the Low Countries, for <span class ="err" title="original: Scandivania">Scandinavia</span>, and frequently
for Germany. The lists cited also include the titles of
certain books (the number being at best but inconsiderable)
which, while published by the Elzevirs, had been
printed for them by other printers; and, finally, they include
the titles of a number of works which, while not
bearing the name of Elzevir, and in fact usually having
on their title-page a Lyons or a Cologne imprint, have been
identified, through the character of their typography, as
coming from one of the Elzevir printing-offices, while,
later, it was discovered, chiefly through the investigation
of Willems, that for certain classes of books the Elzevirs
had made a practice of utilising one of two or three bogus
imprints which they had invented for the purpose. By
far the larger proportion of the Elzevir publications,
probably more than nine-tenths, were printed in Latin.
The texts in French were the next in importance, followed,
in the order named, by those in Dutch, Greek,
Italian, and Arabic.</p>

<p>The general character of the literature in the production
of which the family had interested itself, is indicated,
however roughly, by the titles cited. The books belonged,
in the main, to the class that would to-day be
described as “heavy literature.” The classics, Greek
and Latin, form the larger portion of the list, while there
were also groups of important works in Calvinistic Theology,
Metaphysics, Medicine, Natural Science, Political
Science, History, and Biography. Fiction and legend
were represented not at all, and poetry to but an inconsiderable
extent. The dramatic list, while not large, was
important, including as it did the great productions of
Corneille and Molière.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span></p>

<p>The works of the Fathers of the Church, which had
formed so important a portion of the undertakings of the
printer-publishers of the preceding century, were represented
on the Elzevir list only by an edition of the <i>Confessions</i>
of S. Augustine. It is evident that the demand
for these had been naturally lessened by the influence of
the Reformation. It is rather surprising that the Elzevirs
did not give a larger measure of attention to the
publication of editions of the Scriptures, as the interest
in the Bible was unquestionably very great in the communities
which had accepted the Calvinistic and Lutheran
doctrines. According to the catalogues, however, they
published during the century but one edition of the Bible
in Dutch and one in French. To these should be added
several issues of the New Testament, printed in Greek,
and evidently planned to meet the University requirements.
The most noteworthy publishing undertaking,
and the one which probably brought to the name of
Elzevir the largest measure of prestige throughout Europe,
and also the largest business returns, was the magnificent
series of Classics, printed in duodecimo.</p>

<p>While by far the larger proportion of the publications
of the century were the work of authors of a past generation,
the Elzevir catalogues included the names of a
number of contemporary writers, the works of whom
have achieved an abiding fame. Without repeating the
catalogue, I will refer here only to Descartes, Galileo,
Grotius, Salmasius, Heinsius (father and son), Molière,
Hobbes, etc. The historians of the Elzevirs do not give
(doubtless because they have not been able to find) the
record of the arrangements entered into between these
contemporary authors and their publishers. They can
only point out that, according to the evidence of the
correspondence, the relations between the Elzevirs and
the scholars resident in the Low Countries, whose works
they printed, appear to have been very satisfactory, and
resulted in a number of cases in close personal friendship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
As far as the foreign authors were concerned, the Elzevirs
appear to have followed simply the dictates of their own
convenience and advantage. They took what material
they thought they could use, without troubling themselves
to make either requests or acknowledgments.
They were, in fact, the most extensive piratical publishers
that the world had as yet seen, and may be said to
have reduced piracy to a business system.</p>

<p>It would, however, be very absurd to pass judgment by
the standard of later times, upon the literary appropriations
of the publishers of the seventeenth century. It is
not probable that either the Elzevirs or their publishing
contemporaries had any thought that in reprinting French,
English, or German books, they were causing wrong either
to the writers or to the original publishers, or that their
action could be considered as an interference with any
existing rights. Using the term in its strict legal sense,
there were, of course, at this time no “rights” in literary
productions outside of the territory covered by any particular
“privilege.” The Elzevirs were accustomed to
protect their own books, both the works of contemporary
authors and the editions of old time writers, by privileges
covering the territories of the Republic, and they occasionally
secured also a privilege from the French Crown.</p>

<p>It does not appear that any of the foreign works reprinted
by them had been placed under the protection of
a Dutch privilege, and, in fact, I find no references in the
correspondence that has been preserved to any questions
of infringement of privilege protection, with which the
Elzevirs had to do either as complainants or as defendants.
It is probable that even in the territory covered by a
privilege, the difficulty of enforcing the same under the
law was considerable, and that publishers and editors
found it wise for the most part to accept the annoyance
of interference and of competition rather than to incur the
labour and expense of an appeal to the authorities. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
was also doubtless the case that the superior facilities for
production and for distribution possessed by the Elzevirs,
enabled them to protect themselves pretty effectively
against any unauthorised competition, at least in the Low
Countries.</p>

<p>I find record of no complaints from Molière, Scarron,
or Hobbes, or from any other of the foreign authors whose
works the Elzevirs printed, and it is probable either that
these authors did not think it worth while to waste words
on an evil for which there was no remedy, or that (as was
the case with the Sieur de Balzac, whose letters have been
quoted) they considered the issue of Elzevir editions of
their writings as an honour which added to their literary
fame.</p>

<p>While many details have been preserved of the business
history of the Elzevirs, I find no reference to their books
of account, and no record of manufacturing expenditures
such as has been preserved of the Antwerp publisher,
Plantin. I have, therefore, been unable to ascertain what
payments were made to the home authors like Descartes,
Grotius, Heinsius, and others, of whose works repeated
editions were issued. As these later editions were in the
majority of cases revised by the authors themselves, it is
evident that they must have been published under some
satisfactory arrangement. It would also have been interesting
to ascertain what remuneration was paid for editorial
service, especially in such undertakings as the great
series of Classics, for translations, for the work of press
supervision, and for the service of literary counsel, of
which the Elzevirs secured from scholarly associates a
very full measure. But the data for such information are
not available.</p>

<p>There is a similar lack of information concerning the
success or the lack of success of the different publishing
undertakings. We can only conclude from the fact that
so large a proportion of the books printed reached later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
editions, in some cases being reprinted five or six times,
that for these works, at least, a continued and a remunerative
sale was secured. The references in the correspondence
from different parts of Europe give evidence
that the most important of the undertakings of the House,
the series of Latin and Greek Classics, had won for itself
a favourable reception with students and scholars in far
distant educational centres, and it is evident that the total
sale of these volumes must have been very considerable.</p>

<p>There is also what might be called the negative testimony
to the general success of the publishing judgment
of the Elzevirs, that there is record on their long list of
no single undertaking of importance which proved a burdensome
failure, as was the case, for instance, with the
great Bible of Plantin. It was certainly the case that
the thorough organisation of the bookselling business of
the House, an organisation which included connections not
only throughout the Netherlands, but with the principal
book-centres of Germany, France, Scandinavia, and Italy,
gave them in the work of finding a market for the output
of their presses, a very material advantage over the firms
whose business was limited to printing and publishing.
The catalogues issued by the several retail concerns
carried on by the Elzevirs were by far the most comprehensive,
the best classified, and in every way the most
complete that had as yet been known in the book trade,
and these catalogues served as models for the trade bibliographies
of the succeeding half century.</p>

<p>One very material advantage which was enjoyed by the
Elzevirs as compared with other families whose names
belong to the record of publishing, was the continued
vitality of the family itself, a vitality which ensured the
carrying on of the work of the House effectively through
three generations. In each one of the two generations
which succeeded that of Louis the founder, there were
from two to five representatives who had the interest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
the ability to continue the special work which had brought
fame to the family. Such a persistency of family purpose
and of living representatives of the family competent to
carry out such purpose has been paralleled in but few
other instances. The publishing business of the Rivingtons
of London is now (1896) being directed by a Rivington
of the fifth generation from its foundation by Charles
Rivington, in 1711, and with an existence of one hundred
and eighty-five years, has doubtless a longer career to
boast of than can be credited to any other family which
has devoted itself to publishing. The House of Murray,
of London, is now in the hands of two Murrays of the
fourth generation, and can show an unbroken record of
about a century.</p>

<p>In certain respects, however, the Harpers, of New
York, present a closer parallel to the Elzevirs. The two
English firms above referred to, have depended for their
continuation in more than one of their generations upon
a single representative. The Harpers, however, whose
business is now in the hands of a third generation assisted
by active members of a fourth, have, like the Elzevirs,
found in each generation a sturdy group of representatives,
imbued with the traditions of the House, and able
and willing to devote themselves to carrying forward its
work, and the activities and prestige of the House bid
fair to be extended and expanded through the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>Omitting the names of certain Elzevirs of the fourth
and fifth generation who, while continuing certain interests
in connection with book-selling, did not continue the
business of printing or of publishing, eleven Elzevirs were,
in the three generations from the founder, actively engaged
as typographers and as publishers. Four names
are, however, to be borne more particularly in mind, of
the men who impressed their individual force and character
upon the business and to whom its creation, expansion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
and direction were practically due. Louis, the
founder, had, in various respects, by far the most difficult
task of the four. The special character of his work and
the nature of the obstacles overcome by him, have already
been described. His ambition and ability passed in
largest measure to his youngest son, Bonaventure (leaving
out of the count Adrian, who died young). Bonaventure
directed the fortunes of the Leyden House during
the most successful period of its existence. The grandsons
of Louis, Louis the second and Daniel, can share
between them the responsibility for the distinctive work
done by the House in Amsterdam, a work which, by the
time Daniel was left in sole control, very much exceeded
in importance all that had been accomplished in Leyden.</p>

<p>It seems evident that, while the connection with the
University had been, as was so frequently the case with
the earlier publishing undertakings of Europe, of very
material and perhaps indispensable service in initiating
the business of the House, the trade facilities offered by
a great commercial centre like Amsterdam were of still
greater value than the coöperation and material to be
secured from the University.</p>

<p>No one of the Elzevirs appears to have been entitled
to be described as a scholar, although Daniel, the last of
the House, was evidently a man of a wide range of cultivation
and of attainments. Each one, however, of the
family who had responsibilities in the management of the
publishing interests, evidently possessed adequate judgment
as to what constituted scholarship, and they were
always able to secure in the selection of their material, in
the higher class of editorial work, and in supervising the
printing of the more exacting classes of books, the service
of some of the most learned men who were at the
time resident in Holland. Not a few of these scholarly
assistants and associates became, as said, near friends of
their publishers or of their chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span></p>

<p>The Elzevirs did not have upon their hands the peculiar
responsibilities that had to be met by the printer-publishers
of the preceding generations. It was not necessary for
them, as it had been for Aldus, to ransack distant convents
for manuscripts, and to do the personal work of
collating and preparing these manuscripts for the compositors.
The Elzevirs were, in nearly every instance, in
a position, for their classical publications, to give to the
type dealers printed “copy,” the text of which had had
the advantage of the supervision of a long series of previous
editors. It was not necessary for the Elzevirs to create
methods of organisation for a printing-office, or themselves
to invent mechanism for the production of books.
At the time their work was begun, printing was already
if not a perfected at least a well developed art, the processes
of which had been very fully worked out. They
were able, after utilising to best advantage the experience
of previous generations, so far themselves to develop
and improve methods and results as to make of printing
not only an art but a fine art; and even if they had never
placed a publishing imprint upon a title-page, they would,
through their service as typographers, have earned an
honourable place in the annals of bookmaking.</p>

<p>In their work as publishers, they had a very great advantage
in doing business in a country in which literature
was practically free from the burdensome interference of
censorship. When we recall the long series of contests
carried on by the printers of Venice and of Florence
against the ecclesiastical censorship of Rome, and the almost
equally hampering obstacles placed upon the printer-publishers
of Paris, first by the theologians of the
Sorbonne, and, later, by the officials of the Crown, we
can appreciate the value of the freedom enjoyed by the
Press in Leyden and in Amsterdam, in the history of
publishing in which places, there is hardly a single reference
to the burdens of interference or censorship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span></p>

<p>The successive generations of Elzevirs seem always
to have been (as was certainly the case with Louis the
founder) consistent Calvinists, and they were unwilling to
place their imprint upon any publications assailing the
doctrines of the Reformed Church. While they certainly
rendered a very large service indeed to the development
of book-making and of book-selling in Europe, and by
this means, to the extension of the influence of literature,
it would probably not be accurate to claim that they were
men of exceptionally high ideals. They were traders,
although traders on a great scale and with comprehensive
and far reaching ideas as to the possibilities of their trade.
Their business appears to have been carried on, however,
with little reference to anything except their own business
advantage. It could not be said of them, as it was
of Aldus, that they were willing to risk their fortunes for
the sake of bringing new ideas to Europe; or, as was the
case with Robert Estienne, that they were prepared to
sacrifice both fortune and life, if necessary, in order to
maintain the freedom of the Press and the right of bringing
the Scriptures to the people.</p>

<p>It was probably true that, however unconsciously, they
were able to do an important work in helping to prepare
the way for interstate copyright. They had themselves,
as we have seen, no idea of the possibility of securing the
protection of the law for literary productions beyond the
territory that could be covered by a privilege or by a
series of privileges. In extending, however, the sale of
their own publications in countries far distant from the
“country of origin” and in finding sale not only in their
home city, but in the cities of Germany and Scandinavia,
for the works of widely separated authors, they helped to
develop in several communities the understanding that
literary productions had nothing to do with political
boundaries, that the readers of one country were of necessity
dependent upon the literature of all countries, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
that the boundaries of the world of literature were the
boundaries of civilisation.</p>

<p>This is the conception that forms a necessary foundation
for the idea of International Copyright. It is under
such a conception that the reader comes to feel that sense
of obligation to the author, which makes him more than
ready to pay to such author a return for the service rendered.
When such a relation has once been established
between authors and their readers, it becomes practicable
to secure from communities the recognition by law of the
rights of authors to such returns. It may fairly be said,
therefore, that in creating and in developing the business
of distributing literature throughout Europe, the Elzevirs
took the first step that was necessary in order to bring
about the European copyright, which was finally secured,
two centuries later, under the Convention of Berne.</p>

<p class="center">PRIVILEGES AND CENSORSHIP IN ITALY.</p>

<p class="center">1498-1798.</p>
</div>

<p class="noin dropcap">THE legislation of the Venetian Republic in regard to
privileges, monopolies, and copyrights was more
continuous and more important than that of any
Italian State. In fact, the enactments of the other
States for the supervision of printing and for the encouragement
and protection of literary productions were so
far similar to those of Venice (upon which many of them
had probably been modelled) that the series of Venetian
laws can be taken as fairly representative of the general
system prevailing in Italy during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. The requirements of my subject will,
therefore, be most conveniently met by confining my
record for Italy to a summary of the copyright legislation
of Venice, in place of undertaking to give the details for
each Italian city in which printing was carried on. For
the data of this record I am largely indebted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
scholarly treatise of Horatio F. Brown, on <i>The Venetian
Printing Press</i>, to which previous reference has been
made.</p>

<p>The action of the Government in regard to the book-trade
presents itself in two main divisions: the first
including the steps taken to protect and encourage the
new art and those concerned in it; and the second, the
measures planned to protect the State from certain dangers
which it was dreaded might be brought upon it by
the operations of the Press. Under the first heading
are to be classed monopolies, copyrights, patents, and
protection against foreign competition; while under the
second come the measures of censorship—religious, moral,
and political. The term “<i>privilegii</i>” was applied to all
copyrights, patents, monopolies, and special concessions
having to do with books and printing.</p>

<p>Between 1469 and 1517, these <i>privilegii</i> were, as a rule,
granted by the College or Cabinet of Venice, and their
record is to be found in the Minutes of the Cabinet.
Occasionally, however, the Senate conferred the privilege,
and sometimes a concession was issued under the direction
of the chiefs of the Council. While privileges appear
to have been freely granted to all <i>bona fide</i> applicants,
the Government did not make the securing of a privilege
obligatory upon the publisher.</p>

<p>The first kind of privilege was a simple monopoly,
under which the Government granted to the beneficiary
for a term of years the sole right to print or to sell a
whole class of books. The earliest Venetian privilege on
record, which is also probably the earliest in Italy, was
that of 1469, under which a monopoly was given to John
of Speyer, for a period of five years, for the printing of
books in Venice. Fortunately for the development in
this city of the art of printing and of the business of publishing,
John died shortly after securing this monopoly.
It was not continued to his heirs, and Jenson, Nicolas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
of Frankfort, and their associates were left free to push
their printing operations as they saw fit.</p>

<p>The second class of privilege was that securing to an
author the copyright in his production. This constitutes,
of course, a recognition of the existence of literary property
and of the rights of literary producers. The earliest
record of such a copyright in Venice (and also the earliest
for Italy) bears date September 1, 1486. It secures to
Mr. Antonio Sabellico, historian to the Republic, for apparently
an indefinite term, the sole right to publish, or
to authorise the publication of, his <i>Decades rerum Venetarium</i>.
The penalty for infringement was five hundred
ducats. The words of the concession are worth quoting,
as, in securing for the author a literary proprietorship in
his work, it established a precedent of great importance:</p>

<p><i>Quod opus prefatum per Marcum Antonium prefatum
dari possit alicui diligenti impressori qui opus illud imprimat
suis sumptibus et edat et nemini præter eum liceat
opus illud imprimi facere.</i><a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1493, a more formal and explicit recognition
of literary proprietorship was given in the privilege
granted to Daniele Barbaro, securing to him for ten years
a copyright in the work of his deceased brother Hermolao
Barbaro, the <i>Castigationes Plinii</i>. In January, 1492, a
copyright for an unspecified term was granted to Peter of
Ravenna for his work <i>Phœnix</i> or <i>Fœnix</i>. The form used is
the same as that of the privilege given to Sabellico. No
one is to print the work except under the authority of
the author. Klostermann and others have referred to
this privilege for Peter’s <i>Phœnix</i> as the earliest instance
in Europe of government recognition of an author’s
copyright, but, as we have seen, the protection given to
Sabellico antedates this by nearly six years.</p>

<p>The third class of privilege is that securing to an editor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>or publisher a copyright for works not of his own (literary)
production, and it is of this class that the instances are
the most numerous. The earliest example of a copyright
to an editor is that granted, in 1493, to Joannes Nigro
for his edition of <i>Haliabas</i>. The formula is the same as
that used in the copyrights to authors. In the same year
a copyright (also without a term limitation) was given to
the printer-publisher Bernadino de Benaliis for the work
by Giustiniani, entitled <i>De Origine Urbis Venetiarum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>In connection with this class of copyrights, abuses soon
arose. Copyrights were secured by a number of printers,
or printer-publishers, for works which they never issued,
and which, in not a few cases, they apparently never intended
to issue. The possession of these privileges was
used to obtain from <i>bona fide</i> publishers purchase moneys
for which no service had been rendered either to the
community or to the individuals, and when these moneys
could not be afforded or were not paid, there resulted a
block in publishing undertakings.</p>

<p>The fourth kind of privilege conceded by the Venetian
College was of the nature of a patent rather than a copyright.
It secured a protection for improvements and
developments in the art of printing, or for specific classes
of literature. In 1496, for instance, a privilege was given
to Aldus by the Venetian Government, for a term of
twenty years, for all books that he might print in Greek
text. In connection with this copyright, he secured
what might be called a patent right for his particular
character of Greek type and for his special method of
printing. In his petition he represented that in the making
of these Greek fonts, he had invested a large part of
his resources.</p>

<p>In 1501, Aldus obtained a copyright of ten years for
all works printed in the cursive or italic character, of
which he claimed the invention, and which possessed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>special advantage of compactness. The Greek type was
said to have been modelled on the script of Musurus, as
the cursive was a fac-simile of the writing of Boccaccio.</p>

<p>In 1498, a monopoly for the term of twenty-five
years was granted to Terracina for all books printed in
Arabic, Moorish, Syriac, Armenian, Indian, and Barbary.
Throughout the sixteenth century, a number of patents
were granted for improvements in the art of printing.</p>

<p>The four classes of privileges thus far cited were concerned
with the protection of the individual producer
against competition within the Venetian State. A fifth
kind of privilege had for its purpose the protection of
Venetian printing and publishing as a whole against the
competition of foreign rivals. The Government of Venice
upheld what would now be called a protective system,
and it undertook to secure its industries against interference
or competition from foreigners.</p>

<p>In the printing privilege granted to John of Speyer, in
1469, provision was made to prohibit the importation of
books printed elsewhere, a provision that, if strictly enforced,
must have weighed rather heavily upon Venetian
scholars and students, and in necessitating the reprinting,
for a comparatively small community, of any books required
for Venetian readers, must have tended to keep
the price of those books high.</p>

<p>In all the privileges subsequently granted appears a
provision prohibiting the importation of any foreign edition
of the work securing Venetian copyright. Such a
prohibition, however, is of course in line with the restrictive
and protective features of modern copyright law, and
is a very different thing from the attempt made in the
edict of 1769, previously quoted, to prevent the importation
into Venetian territory of any books printed abroad.
The former restriction constitutes an essential feature of
any system of copyright, while the latter was a kind of
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the theory of “protection to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
home industries.” In 1519, in a copyright granted to
Manenti, physician to the Duke of Urbino, appears the
condition that the book securing Venetian copyright
must be printed in Venetian territory; and in the copyrights
issued thereafter this proviso is seldom omitted.
A similar provision finds place in a number of the copyright
enactments of later times, the most recent instance
being the American law of 1891.</p>

<p>The applications for privileges or copyrights submitted
by the printer-publishers were quite frequently accompanied
by special reasons why in each particular case such
a petition should be granted. Sometimes it was on the
ground of the general excellence of their printing and their
guaranty that the edition now proposed shall possess
special beauty and accuracy of typography; sometimes
they engage to secure the highest grade of scholarship for
the text revision and for the editorial work; again they
will plead poverty or distress, or large families to support,
or special need of some kind.</p>

<p>In the year 1493, we have an example of an application
for a privilege being accompanied by a certificate from
certain competent authorities as to the value and the importance
for the community of the work to be published.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
The applicant was Bernardino de Benaliis, and the publications
in question were the works of Beato Lorenzo
Giustiniani and of Tartagni da Imola. Benaliis submitted
from a number of the doctors in law at the University of
Padua certificates as to the value of the book.</p>

<p>Foreigners made a practice of supporting their petitions
with letters of commendation, either from the ambassadors
of their own states, or of some other of the foreign
ambassadors. The applications or petitions were not
always granted, and, occasionally, conditions were attached
upon which the continued validity of the privilege
was made to depend. Such conditions fell into four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>general divisions, concerned with, first, the quality of the
work to be produced, secondly (though infrequently) the
speed of its production, thirdly the price at which it was
to be sold, and fourthly the rights of the producers, <i>i.e.</i>,
publishers. As an example of the first kind can be noted
the privilege granted to Benaliis, already cited, under
which he is bound not to publish the works of Tartagni
without those of Giustiniani, nor <i>vice versa</i>, and he must
further guarantee to print the volumes in the finest style
of typography and with the most correct text.</p>

<p>The privilege given in 1494 for certain books to be
issued by Matteo de Codeca, is coupled with the condition
that the volumes are to be sold at a “fair price”
(<i>pretio honestissimo</i>), and a similar term is used in the
privilege given in 1496 to Landriano. In a certain number
of the privileges, principally those of earlier date, we
find the condition that the works must be published
within a year from the date of the application, or must
be printed at a certain rate per week.</p>

<p>The College kept no register of the privileges issued by
it other than the entries in its minutes, and it happened
not infrequently, as the number of petitions increased,
that exclusive privileges for the same work were granted
to different applicants. Conflicts naturally arose between
two publishers claiming control of the same work, but
when any cases of the kind were brought up for adjudication,
they were decided in favour of the privileges bearing
the earliest date, providing always that the condition of
publishing within a certain term had been complied with.
As a result of these complications, however, the practice
came to be adopted of attaching to a privilege a saving
clause to the effect that it should be invalid in case any
earlier privilege should already have been issued for the
same work.</p>

<p>Among other instances of such a proviso, Brown quotes
that included in the privilege granted, in 1493, to Calcedonio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
which closes thus: <i>declarato, quod hæc gratia intelligatur
casu quo opera ipsa sint nova, et aliquis alius
jam non cœperit illa imprimere, vel sibi promissum fuerit</i>.
Another form, occurring in 1502, was <i>dummodo prius dicta
volumina non fuerint impressa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The Minutes of the College were not open to the inspection
of the public, and it appears that no subject
indexes were kept of the business transacted, while, as
before said, no attempts were made to preserve any list
or register of the privileges issued. The printers and
publishers had, therefore, no safe means of ascertaining
whether or not they were infringing a previous copyright.</p>

<p>The average term of the earlier privileges was ten
years. In the latter half of the sixteenth century, however,
it became the practice to grant longer terms. There
are examples, in 1569, of privileges of twenty years, and,
in 1596, of twenty-four and twenty-five years. The terms
varied, however, very greatly, and it is difficult to trace
the grounds upon which a longer or a shorter time was
decided upon. We find instances of one year, five years,
ten years, fifteen years, etc.</p>

<p>The copyrights run sometimes from the date of the
application and sometimes from that of the publication.
After 1505, the practice obtained of granting prolongations
of privileges in cases in which good cause had been
shown for such prolongation. An instance of such an
extension is the case of Leonardo Crasso’s edition of the
works of Polifilo, for which, in 1508, a second copyright
term of ten years was granted on the ground that the
wars had prevented the publisher from getting back his
investment. The principal difficulty with these earlier
privileges was the absence of any machinery to secure their
enforcement or the protection of the owners of the copyrights.
Brown says that there is no instance or record
of a suit being brought by one printer against another for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>infringement of copyright. Complaints for infringement
were presented from time to time to the College or to the
Council of Ten. In 1499, the Council of Ten issued an
order to publishers to respect the copyrights granted to
Antonio Moretto of Brescia.</p>

<p>In 1495, Biondo and Giambattista secured for ten years
a privilege in the Letters of S. Catherine of Siena. The
same work was, however, published by Aldus in 1500,
five years before Biondo’s privilege had expired. The
<i>Letters of Phalaris</i> were published in 1498 by Braccio, and
in 1499 by Aldus, and there appears to have been no
determination of the question to whom the privilege or
copyright belonged. The whole business of copyrights
resting upon individual privileges fell into confusion, and
the difficulties in the way of protecting literary property
must have seriously interfered with the development of
publishing undertakings.</p>

<p>It must be remembered also, that these privileges, even
if not interfered with, covered the control of but a limited
market, that, namely, comprised in the territory of the
Venetian Republic. In any other States of Italy, the
reprinters were, of course, free to appropriate the results
of the enterprise of the Venetian publishers and of their
expenditures for manuscripts, editorial service, etc.;
while the Venetians had, of course, the same freedom in
utilising the works initiated in Rome, Florence, Milan, or
Verona. In competing for markets outside of Italy, however,
the Venetian publishers had the advantage of the
wide commercial connections possessed by their city.</p>

<p>With an entire absence of protection for his literary
undertakings outside of his own State, it was, of course,
of first importance that, within these limits at least, the
publisher should have secured to him the results of his
planning, his labours, and his investment. Such security
was, however, given but very inadequately by the system
of privileges. The penalties attached to infringements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
hardly acted as deterrents, principally because there was
no effective machinery for their enforcement. These
penalties comprised the confiscation of the contraband
material, with fines varying (for each unauthorised copy
of the book) from twenty soldi to one thousand ducats.
The latter was the fine prescribed, in 1515, in the case of
a piratical edition of Ariosto. The fine, when collected,
was usually divided into three parts, one third going to
the court, one third to the complainant, and one third to
some city charity. Occasionally, though very rarely,
there was added to the penalty a sentence of confinement
in prison for one or two months. There are one or two
instances also of suspension of the offender from the
exercise of the art of printing. Complaints concerning
infringement could usually be brought before any magistrate
of the Republic; but in some cases it was specified
in the privilege itself that a trial for its contravention
should be held before a special court, such as that of the
fiscal procurators, or of the police magistrates. What
uniformity of procedure came finally to be established,
was due, however, less to the regulations of the law than
to the precedents established by the printers and publishers.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">Censorship.</h3><p class="heading">—After the earlier measures having for
their purpose the encouragement of the new art of printing,
the actions of the Government of Venice (as of the
other States where the business of publishing became of
importance) were more largely concerned with the supervision
and regulation of the Press for the safety of the
interests of State and Church, than with the protection
of literary property.</p></div>

<p>As in the case of the privileges, the censorship was, for
something more than half a century, that is, from 1469
to 1528, carried on without the aid of any general law,
and was based simply upon a practice or series of precedents
evolved from the individual action taken by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
Government in each instance as it arose. The granting
of privileges had, as we have seen, been the duty sometimes
of the College, sometimes of the Senate. The
responsibility concerning censorship rested naturally with
the Council of Ten, which in its capacity as a standing
committee of safety, assumed a general charge of the
morals of the community.</p>

<p>The censorship of the Press in Venice, as elsewhere, was
concerned with three aspects of literature: the religious,
the moral (which included the political), and the purely
literary. Morality was considered from both the public
and the private or personal point of view, the former
including as its chief consideration the safety of the
State.</p>

<p>The operation of the censorship was marked by the
presence of an <i>imprimatur</i> or record of authorisations.
As has already been noted, applications for a privilege
were occasionally accompanied by a certificate or <i>testamur</i>
from certain competent authorities, who had examined
the work in question and who were willing to certify as to
its soundness and importance.</p>

<p>The earliest example of an ecclesiastical <i>testamur</i> printed
in a book published in Venice, appears at the beginning
of the <i>Nosce Te</i>, issued by Jenson in 1480. The <i>Nosce
Te</i> was a book of devotion, written by a Carthusian
monk, Giovanni di Dio, and the <i>testamur</i> in this case
might, therefore, be interpreted simply as an approval
by his ecclesiastical superiors of the work done by him as
an ecclesiastic. There is no record that the <i>Nosce Te</i>
ever secured a privilege from the Venetian Government,
and it seems certain that at the date in question no such
<i>testamur</i> was required under the regulations of the secular
government.</p>

<p>No further instance of a clerical <i>testamur</i> occurs before
1505, when Jacomo di Penzi, of Lecco, a printer, in applying
to the Council for a privilege for certain books he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
desired to print, states that he has an <i>imprimatur</i> from
the Council of Ten, and a <i>testamur</i> from the Patriarch as
to the merit of one of the works, the <i>Tre famosissime
Questioni</i>, by Zane, Archbishop of Spalato. In the year
1508, we have the first example of an ecclesiastical <i>testamur</i>
being required by the Council of Ten, as a condition
for their own <i>imprimatur</i>. The work was the
<i>Universalis animæ traditionis liber quintus</i> of Gregoriis,
and the ecclesiastical censor appointed to examine the
work from a theological point of view, reported that he
found in it nothing opposed to Catholic verity.</p>

<p>This is the first instance of a religious censorship exercised
by the secular government. The case may be
considered as fairly indicating the position the Venetian
Government proposed to take in regard to the supervision
of books touching upon theological matters. The
State had a personal interest in protecting the Church
against the attacks of books likely to be subversive of the
faith, and it was glad to secure the opinion of the Church
in regard to the character or tendency of a doubtful
work; but it intended to retain in its own hands the final
decision as to the permission to print; and it contended
that the interests of Church and State could be best protected
by the State taking action for both. The conclusion
arrived at was, therefore, that there should be religious
censorship, but that the censor should act only through
powers delegated to him by the secular government.</p>

<p>A case occurring in 1516 shows, however, that this
policy speedily became modified. Soardi, a publisher,
applied for an <i>imprimatur</i> for certain theological works.
The Council of Ten replies that as Soardi has already
secured the <i>testamurs</i> of the Patriarch and the Inquisitor,
they, <i>quoad se</i>, have no objection to offer, and <i>permittunt
fieri quantum præfati Reverendissimus et Inquisitor concessere</i>.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Brown accepts this phrase, <i>quoad se</i>, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>occurs also in later <i>imprimaturs</i>, as evidence that the
Council of Ten had <span class ="err" title="original: practially">practically</span> resigned the direct control
of the religious censorship, and had accepted the Patriarch
and the Inquisitor as the proper persons to deal with the
responsibility. It is still, however, the secular authority
and not the ecclesiastical which grants the <i>imprimatur</i>,
and the term <i>permittunt fieri</i> implies that the permit was
necessary and could be withheld. In this same year,
1515, a claim was raised by the Papal Government which,
later, gave rise to many disputes between the Church and
the Republic of Venice, and also between the Church
and several other of the States of Italy.</p>

<p>The Holy See assumed the right to grant copyrights
and <i>imprimaturs</i> in States other than those of the Church,
and to support these monopolies by the threat of spiritual
punishments. The earliest instance of such a contention
was that of Fra Felice of Prato, a converted Jew, who
secured from the Pope, for certain Hebrew books and
translations of the same, a copyright which covered not
only the States of the Church but all the States of Europe.
The punishment of excommunication was threatened
against any who refused to recognise this copyright
or who committed infringements against it. Fra Felice,
desiring to print his book in Venice, and apparently
distrusting the adequacy of the Pope’s privilege, applied
to the College for a copyright for ten years, which was
duly granted to him; while the College of Venice apparently
made no comments upon the Papal brief which
had also undertaken to give him authority for Venice.
Later on, the Venetian Government found occasion to
make vigorous protests against similar contentions from
Rome.</p>

<p>The second class of censorship, that relating to literary
quality, also developed but gradually. The need for
some kind of literary supervision is indicated by the publishers
themselves, who in their petitions make reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
to the misprints and scandalous errors in editions previously
produced, and promise that their own editions
shall be printed with the utmost care and accuracy.</p>

<p>The earliest instance of the establishment of a literary
censorship was in 1503, when the Senate made Marcus
Musurus censor of all books printed in Greek. Thirteen
years later Musurus was still holding the office.</p>

<p>In 1515, an order was issued by the Council of Ten
which established a general censorship for the literature
of the Humanities. The order was worded as follows:
“In all parts of the world, and in the famous cities not
only of Italy but also of barbarous countries, that the
honour of the nation may be preserved, it is not allowed
to publish works until they shall have been examined by
the most learned person available. But in this our city,
so famous and so worthy, no thought has as yet been
bestowed on this matter, whence it comes to pass that the
most incorrect editions which appear before the world are
those issued in Venice, to the dishonour of the city. Be
it, therefore, charged upon our noble Andrea Navagero
to examine all works in Humanity which, for the future,
may be printed; and without his signature in the volumes
they shall not be printed, under pain of being confiscated
and burned, and a fine of three hundred ducats for him
who disobeys this order.” This is the first Italian example
of a general or prevention censorship, applied to a
whole class of literature.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The third kind of censorship concerned itself with the
morals of literature, political morality, the attitude of the
writer or of the publisher towards the State or rather
towards government, and private morality, having to do
with the influence of the book upon decency and <i>bonos
mores</i>. The Government of Venice was peculiarly sensitive
in regard to any criticism, direct or indirect, of its
public documents. In 1515, the Council of Ten granted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>permission to Marino Sanuto, who was engaged in the
preparation of a history of the operations of Charles VIII.
in Italy, to examine the State Papers of more than two
years back, on the condition that the work should, when
completed, be submitted for the approval of the Council,
before any one else should have seen it. Later in the
same year, an <i>imprimatur</i> was granted to Andrea Mocenigo
for his history of the League of Cambrai, the work
having been examined and approved by the Grand Chancellor,
who had the special custody of the State Papers.</p>

<p>The political censorship was apparently more effective
than the censorship of morals. It was certainly the case
that the <i>imprimatur</i> was given to not a few books of a
scandalous character.</p>

<p>In 1527, Alvise Cynthio (or Fabritii) published a work
on <i>The Origin of Vulgar Proverbs</i>. He had secured from
the Senate a copyright for ten years, which prohibited
any one from reprinting the collection unless he should
add to the material as many new proverbs as were contained
in the original. Cynthio took occasion to say in
one of his editorial paragraphs that he intended to show
the true character of those who pretended to follow the
rule of S. Francis. The Franciscans naturally found objections
to the book, and registered a complaint against
it on the ground of heresy and indecency.</p>

<p>The Council of Ten issued in January, 1526-1527 a
general order, reciting that, owing to the freedom which
everyone enjoys in Venice, it sometimes happens that
obscene and corrupt works issue from the Press. It is,
therefore, decreed that for future publications, the <i>imprimatur</i>
of the Council of Ten shall be required, and
that before this is given, the work must have been examined
by two censors, who shall make a sworn report that
its character is satisfactory. This order is of importance
as being the first official recognition of the necessity of a
moral censorship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span></p>

<p>The censors who examined Cynthio’s volume, ordered
the author to expunge the obnoxious passages. In the
meantime, however, the monks took the matter into
their own hands (although they claimed to act with the
authority of the Council) and carried off from the printer’s
shop all the copies on hand. Cynthio petitioned
the Council for their restoration, and the printer put in a
claim on his part that the volumes should be replaced in
his hands until his printing account had been paid. An
order to such effect was given, but apparently only a
small portion of the volumes were received, the others
having disappeared while in the custody of the monks.
Copies of the work have since been extremely rare. The
author is reported to have died a violent death.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Up to this time there had been no attempt to formulate
a code of laws for the regulation of the Press; such
action as had been taken by the Government, had been
in the shape of isolated decrees, or special acts prepared
to meet specific cases. There was no such thing as preventive
legislation; it was always planned either to present
a remedy for some immediate difficulty or to repress
some specific wrong-doing. The lines upon which the
press-code of Venice was finally promulgated had, however,
been gradually indicated by the customs and precedents
established for particular cases.</p>

<p>Before the period of general legislation, the practice
had, as we have seen, been arrived at by securing, first
from the College, and later from the Senate, privileges,
taking the shape either of monopolies or of copyrights;
while for the <i>imprimatur</i> or authority to print, application
was made to the Council of Ten. The first law of
censorship made such <i>imprimatur</i> obligatory. The censorship
of the character of the books thus fell upon the
Ten, which retained in its own hands the direct control
of the political censorship and delegated to ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>examiners the task of theological censorship, accepting,
as a rule, the report of such examiners as final. When,
later, it was found necessary to give consideration not
only to the political and theological influence of books,
but to their literary quality and their moral character,
these divisions of the censorship were also assumed by
the Council of Ten.</p>

<p>In 1487, was issued the first Papal Bull having to do
with the productions of the printing-press. It was addressed
by Pope Innocent VIII. to seven governments as
follows: Romana, Curia, Italia, Germania, Francia, Hispania,
Anglia, and Scotia. It is entitled: <i>Bulla S. D.
N. Innocentii contra Impressores Librorum Rebrobatorum</i>,
and was printed in Rome in 1487. The opening paragraph
reads: <i>Et ea propter nos qui illius locum tenemus in
terris qui ad illuminandum hominum mentes et errorum
tenebros exterminandum descendit e coelis</i> (and, therefore,
we who hold on earth the place of Him who came
down from heaven to enlighten the minds of men and to
disperse the darkness of error).</p>

<p>The Bull does not appear to have attracted any special
attention in Venice, and the Government of the Republic
continued to frame in its own way the regulations for the
control of the printers.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Earliest Legislation in Venice.</h3><p class="heading">—The legislation
of the Republic relating to the productions of the printing-press
concerned itself with five general purposes:
first, the embodiment into law of custom and precedent;
second, the protection against outside competition of the
book-manufacturing trade of Venice, and the preservation
of the excellence of the Venetian Press; third, the
protection of the book-buyer against bad workmanship
and exorbitant charges; fourth, the protection of the
author’s rights; fifth, the institution of a Bureau to administer
the Press laws and to regulate the industry.</p></div>

<p>The legislative bodies of the State were the Senate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
the Council of Ten. The earliest legislation for the regulation
of the Press (unless we may count as a law the
general order of the Ten, previously referred to, establishing
a literary censorship for works in Humanity) was
a law of the Senate passed August 1, 1517. This law
recalled every privilege heretofore granted, placing in the
public domain, open for the use of any one, all of the
works named in these cancelled privileges.</p>

<p>The purpose of this law was to sweep away a mass of
obstruction, and in giving full freedom to printing undertakings,
to further the development of Venetian publishing.
Among its advocates were many of the printer-publishers,
who were willing to lose their property rights
in existing copyrights for the sake of getting rid of the
evils that had arisen from the accumulation of overlapping
privileges, or of privileges which had been secured
not for direct use but for obstruction and for sale, and of
privileges which on various grounds had not been obtained
in good faith. Under the law of 1517, privileges were
thereafter to require a two-thirds vote in the Senate and
were to be issued only for works which were new or which
had not before been printed. (<i>Solum pro libris et operibus
novis, numquam antea impressis et non pro aliis.</i>)</p>

<p>The next law, that of 1526, has already been referred
to in connection with the case of Cynthio’s <i>Origin of
Vulgar Proverbs</i>. It provided that no book should be
printed without the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Council, and that
this <i>imprimatur</i> should be granted only after the book
had been approved by two censors appointed by the
Council as free from scandalous or objectionable matter.</p>

<p>In 1533, the question of copyright was again attracting
attention. The law of 1517 had not worked well, and
abuses had arisen under it. No definition had been given
limiting or constructing the term <i>opus novum</i>, and the
contention had been made that very slight additions or
alterations in a book already published would constitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
it a new work within the meaning of the act. It was
only necessary for a publisher to make application, under
such a contention, for a copyright for a previously unprinted
classic, to prevent the work from being printed
by any other publisher.</p>

<p>A decree was now issued ordering that a publisher must
complete the publication of a work within twelve months
from the date of securing his copyright, under pain of the
forfeiture of the copyright. A modification was afterwards
made under which, if the work was too large to be
completed within a year, the copyright could be preserved
by the production of not less than one folio a day.
If the work were printed out of Venice, the copyright was
forfeited. No publisher could apply twice for a copyright
for the same work. The matter of prices was also gone
into; and publishers were directed to submit to the
Bureau of Arts and Industries an advance copy of each
new book, which was to be appraised by experts and the
price set by them was to be that at which the book should
be published. No copies were to be sold at any higher
price.</p>

<p>In 1537, a further law was enacted, directed to the
protection of the interests of the consumer, and to the
wholesome development of the trade of book-manufacturing.
The preamble speaks of “the ruinous and disgraceful
practices of the Venetian printers,” who used to
be the best in the world, and complains that now, for the
sake of gain, they use vile paper that will not hold the
ink and that cannot be written upon with marginal notes.
This blemish cannot be due to any difficulty in securing
proper material, as foreign books come to Venice printed
on excellent paper.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, ordered that under a penalty of forfeiture
of copyright and a fine of one hundred ducats, all
copyrighted books must be printed on paper that can be
written upon without blotting. This penalty shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
incurred if of any edition five copies blot, and a copy
shall be held to be defective if any five leaves in it blot.
Pamphlets and books below the value of ten <i>soldi</i> are excepted
from the provisions of the law. New books are
again defined as works which have never been published
before. The execution of the law is given to the <i>Avogadori
di Comun</i>, the law officers of the State.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The enactments of 1542-1543 give evidence that the
regulations for the supervision of the publishing trade had
not yet produced satisfactory results, and that there was
no little irritation on the part of the Government at their
failure. The Council complains that, contrary to the
censorial law of 1526, its <i>imprimatur</i> was not always
sought for new publications, and that, as a result of this
non-observance, books were being printed and sold which
offended the honour of God, were repugnant to the Christian
Faith, and were in many instances most licentious.
To remedy these evils, it was decreed that the printers
of unlicensed books should be fined fifty ducats, in addition
to the penalties previously decreed. The booksellers
dealing in them were to be fined twenty-five ducats, while
those who hawked unlicensed books about the streets
were to be flogged from S. Mark’s to the Rialto, and to
be imprisoned for six months. A publisher using a false
imprint was to be imprisoned for twelve months, and
then banished from Venice in perpetuity.</p>

<p>In spite of these severe penalties, the law does not
appear to have secured more satisfactory obedience than
had been given to the previous decrees. As Brown
points out, the law was probably not supported by public
opinion.</p>

<p>In 1544, the Commissioners of the University of Padua
were constituted the permanent censors of Venetian books
submitted for the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Council. The censorship
of the Commissioners covered all points excepting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>those relating to religion or theology, which were still left
to be passed upon by ecclesiastical censors.</p>

<p>In 1544-5, the Council of Ten gave attention to the
question of the ownership of literary productions. In no
one of the several acts that had been passed for the regulation
of the Press, had it been made apparent whether
literary property was brought into existence as property,
by the process of securing the copyright, or whether it
existed, <i>ipso facto</i>, in the author of a work. In the latter
case, the copyright entry and the issue of the privilege
constituted simply an official recognition of the right and
not a creation of it. During the half century in which
their business had been carried on, the printer-publishers
in Venice (in common with those of the rest of Europe)
were in the habit of ignoring literary proprietorship altogether,
and were accustomed to print any work they
pleased, even in direct opposition to the wishes of the
author. It became evident that some measure for the
protection of the author was necessary, and in the year
1544-5, a decree was issued forbidding anyone to print
or to sell a work without having first presented to the
<i>Rifformatori</i> (the University Commissioners) documentary
proof of the consent of the author or of his representatives.</p>

<p>All books printed without the consent of the author
were to be confiscated and burned; the printer was to be
fined one ducat for each copy of the book printed, and
was to be imprisoned for one month. In 1547, a fresh
attempt was made to restrain the sale of blasphemous or
obscene books.</p>

<p>One manner in which the law of 1543 had been evaded
was by importing books of a character for which an <i>imprimatur</i>
in Venice could not have been secured. Brown
says that in a number of cases, however, books of a scandalous
character, sold as importations, had really been
printed in Venice, the foreign imprint being forged. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
was now ordered that any one importing scandalous books
should pay a fine of fifty ducats, the books themselves
being also forfeited.</p>

<p>The <i>Savii Sopra l’Eresia</i>, the three Venetian noblemen
who served as assessors to the Holy Office, and who now
had in their hands the examination of new publications
with reference to matters of religion or doctrine, were
charged with the supervision also of imported books.
The Lutheran heresy was beginning to be promulgated
by means of the Press, and the ecclesiastical authorities
were, therefore, especially suspicious of literature coming
from Germany.</p>

<p>In 1548, the first catalogue of prohibited books was
issued in Venice. The addition to the regular executive
of the three Commissioners on Heresy indicates as well a
greater activity on the part of the Church in regard to
the supervision of literature, as a readiness on the part of
the Government to accept this ecclesiastical coöperation
as long as, in form at least, the State was recognised as
the controlling authority in the matter.</p>

<p>The year 1548-9 marks an era in the history of printing
and publishing not only in Venice, but of the world.
In that year, under a decree of the Council dated January
18th, the printers, publishers, and booksellers of
Venice were organised into a guild. The very natural
reason assigned for the formation of such a guild was that
the trade in question was the only important trade in the
city that was not already so organised. We find, however,
as an additional reason, which doubtless acted as an
important incentive, the necessity of so organising the
business of the production of books that the work of the
Commissioners of Heresy in discovering and in punishing
the publishers of heretical books, should be facilitated.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Guild of Printers and Booksellers, 1549-1595.</h3>
<p class="heading">—The
organisation into a guild of the printers and publishers
of Venice was an important event in the history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
of literary property in Italy. This guild was the earliest
trade association of book-men in Europe, the decree for
its institution bearing date 1548-9, or six years earlier
than the charter of Queen Mary of England, under which
was incorporated the Stationers’ Company. The publishers
of Germany had organised the Frankfort book-fair
(in connection with the general Fair) as early as 1500,
but this organisation had not yet taken the shape of a
guild. The <i>Libraires jurés</i> of Paris, comprising members
of the University, organised as a division of the University,
and subject to the control of the University authorities,
cannot, at least in its earlier stages, be classed as a
trade guild.</p></div>

<p>The Guild of Venice had, as we have seen, been brought
into existence not merely for the protection of trade interests,
but for the purpose of facilitating the work of the
State and of the Church in keeping a close supervision
upon all the productions of the Press, and of promptly
suppressing those likely to prove pernicious. The regulations
framed by the Guild and the enactments secured
by it were of service in defining literary property and in
protecting copyrights, but this result was rather an incidental
than an essential part of its work.</p>

<p>Seventeen years elapsed after the decree of 1548, before
the organisation of the corporation was fully completed
through the formulation of its by-laws; but from various
references during that time, it seems evident that shortly
after 1548, an association was in existence with a President
and a Council, exercising some general supervision
over the printers and publishers. When the Guild was
finally organised, it appears to have been a more official
and more authoritative body than the London Company of
Stationers. Its officers comprised a prior, two councillors,
six assessors, a secretary, and a beadle. Membership in
the Guild was compulsory upon all master-printers, publishers,
and booksellers, and each member was to pay annually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
<i>the sum of one lira, five soldi. The list of officials</i>
included two syndics, one of whom was to be present at
each election and to administer the oath of office to the
new officers. No member was permitted to decline either
nomination or election, under a penalty of ten ducats.
No member of the Guild could hold office unless during
five years previous he had been a master-printer or had
kept a book-shop. The by-laws of the Guild were called
<i>Mariegole</i>, a term which is said to come from <i>Matricule</i>,
or matriculation books.</p>

<p>The Guild thus constituted, outlived the Government
that had created it and many succeeding governments.
It even survived the Republic and the period of revolutions
and of Napoleonic invasions; and came to a close
only with the first decade of the present century, after an
existence of more than two hundred and fifty years. The
Stationers’ Company of London still exists under that
name, but its control over the printing and publishing
trades of England disappeared many years before the
dissolution of the Guild of Venice.</p>

<p>The Guild appears to have moved but slowly in the
work of controlling the printing and the book-trade of the
city; it was not until 1571 that it issued a decree (which
apparently had the force of a decree of the Council) forbidding
anyone not a member of the Guild from setting
up a printing-press or opening a book-store. It was also
forbidden for anyone to exercise any of the functions of
a printer or a bookseller unless he had served a five years’
apprenticeship in Venice. Foreigners who desired to
exercise the art of printing, or to carry on the business
of bookselling, must first serve five years in some shop in
Venice, and after examination and approval by the authorities
of the Guild, must pay ten ducats for matriculation.
The penalty for infringement of the above decree
was fifty ducats.</p>

<p>A protest was made to the <i>Proveditore di Comun</i> concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
<i>the authority of the Guild to make or to enforce</i>
any such regulation, but the <i>Proveditore</i> promptly confirmed
the action of the Guild, and in so doing confirmed
its authority to control the business of printing and book-selling.</p>

<p>This control seems, however, during no period to
have been complete. Up to the year 1600, the Guild
had at no time contained more than seventy-five members.
In 1596, according to the reports of the <i>Rifformatori</i>,
there were one hundred and twenty presses at work
in Venice, and it was necessary to print one hundred
and fifty copies of the <i>Concordat</i> of 1596, in order to distribute
them among the booksellers of the city. It is
probable, therefore, that the master-printers and book-sellers
must together have exceeded seventy-five, and in
that case the Guild could not have included them all.
While the Guild claimed, as we have seen, full jurisdiction
over the printers and booksellers, and claimed also
the right to forbid any person to carry on these trades
without having obtained a certificate of competence from
its own examiners, it is probable that it lacked the power
to enforce its authority or to carry into effect its decrees.</p>

<p>The establishment of a system of censorship did not
meet all the difficulties in the way of a thorough supervision
and regulation of literature. The University
Commissioners, to whom had been referred the censorship
other than ecclesiastical, were apparently not always
able to make examination of all pending publications or
did not, at least, always insist upon a personal examination.
The publishers began to make a practice (on the
ground of lightening the labours of the Commissioners)
of having their forthcoming works examined by readers
selected by themselves.</p>

<p>On the strength of a favourable report from these
friendly examiners, the Commissioners would issue their
certificate that the work contained nothing objectionable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
and with this <i>testamur</i> the publishers would secure, without
further question, the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Ten. Under
this procedure a number of objectionable works found
their way into print. The Commissioners finally, in
1562, gave orders to their secretary that thereafter no
authorisations should be given for any printing whatsoever
until the work had been examined and favourably
reported upon, first, by the Inquisitor or one of his
vicars, or by some person selected by the Tribunal of the
Inquisition; second, by the Reader in philosophy or
some other public reader; third, by a ducal secretary.
The petitioner for a certificate was to bring a <i>testamur</i>
signed by each of these, declaring that there was nothing
in the book contrary to religion, nothing injurious to
morality, and nothing hostile to princes, and that it was
worthy to see the light. The <i>testamurs</i> should state the
number of leaves in the book and must quote the first and
last lines.</p>

<p>After the book had been printed, but before it was
issued to the public, a copy was to be submitted to
the <i>Rifformatori</i> in order that they might assure themselves
that no additions or alterations had been made
after the securing of the <i>imprimatur</i>. Each of the three
persons who should examine the book was to be paid the
sum of one <i>bezzo</i> for each leaf (sheet?). The <i>bezzo</i> was
worth the one hundred and sixtieth part of a ducat. All
the expenses connected with the three examinations and
with the issue of the <i>imprimatur</i> must be borne by the
petitioner.</p>

<p>Four years later, in 1566, it was ordered that all persons
obtaining licences should, before printing their
works, register their licences at the office of the <i>Esecutori
contro la Bestemmia</i>, but for such registration there
should be no charge. This is the first attempt that was
made to institute a complete registry of the publications
of Venice. Unfortunately, the law was persistently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
evaded, and the registers which have come down to us
are very incomplete.</p>

<p>The system of censorship, as now completed, proved
both cumbersome and irritating, and must have seriously
interfered with the development of the publishing business
of Venice. It was, however, not quite so exacting
as might have been expected from the stringent nature of
its provisions, for the reason that these were not and
could not be effectively enforced. The Government of
Venice lacked the means to enforce its literary regulations,
and had no police adequate to the special requirements
of these regulations.</p>

<p>While the censorship of the State became more or less
nominal, that of the Church was enforced with comparative
rigour, and exercised a very material influence on
the selection of the literature to be printed. The Church
had at hand a very effective machinery for the enforcement
of its supervision, as every priest and every friar
was ready to act as a policeman for the cause of ecclesiastical
control over the Press.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">Copyrights in Venice, 1500-1600.</h3>
<p class="heading">—Up to the middle
of the fifteenth century the average term of a copyright
had been ten years. From the year 1560, the terms
began to increase, until towards the close of the century
the average is nineteen years. There are, however, examples
of terms as short as one year, and as long as thirty;
while it is not easy to trace the grounds for the discrimination.
The fines inflicted for contraband publications
also varied very considerably. The amounts collected were
usually divided into three parts, which were assigned one
to the informer, one to the author, and the third, either
to the court, the arsenal, or to one of the three asylums.
There is record of but one instance during the century of
a piratical printer being deprived of his licence to print.
It was the case of a copyright granted to Pappa Alesio,
of Corfu, the infringer of which was fined two hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
ducats, and ten ducats for each unauthorised copy
printed, and was forbidden to print for ten years.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The number of works for which copyright was secured
varied very much from year to year. The largest number
of entries during the century was one hundred and
seventeen in 1561, and the smallest seven, in 1599. The
decrease during the last quarter of the century was in
part due to the Great Plague.</p>

<p>There were but two instances during the century in
which the Senate refused to grant an application for copyright,
one of these refusals being for the <i>Lettere Amorose</i>
of Pasqualigo. While the greater number of the copyrights
were issued in the names of the publishers, there
is, after the middle of the sixteenth century, an increasing
number of entries in the names of the authors. A copyright
was given, in 1515, to Ariosto for his <i>Orlando</i>, to
last for his lifetime; and in 1535, a copyright was given
to his heirs for a period of ten years for certain of the
poet’s works. Copyrights were also issued directly to
Tasso, Aretino, Giraldi, and other authors.</p>

<p>The making of maps and charts formed, as was natural
in a great centre of commerce, an important feature in
the publishing of Venice; while in company with these,
there were long lists of works of travel and adventure.
Early in the sixteenth century, the production of engravings,
on wood and on copper, grew to be a considerable
industry. In 1521, a copyright was issued to Castellazzo
for certain illustrations for the <i>Pentateuch</i> which he had
engraved and for certain others which he had in plan.</p>

<p>During the whole of the century, Venice continued to
be the chief publishing centre in Europe for Greek literature,
and a place of resort for Greek scholars. Its presses
also became noted for the printing of books in Hebrew.
This latter industry, however, had to encounter no little
opposition on the part of the Government, an opposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>in the main due to jealousy of the ecclesiastical censors,
who dreaded the heresies that might be hidden in the
unknown tongue. The dread was, however, one that
might be overcome if the inducement were sufficient.
The printer Bomberg, who had been refused a renewal of
his ten years’ privilege for his Hebrew publications, made
fresh application with successive offers of one hundred, one
hundred and fifty, and three hundred ducats, all of which
were rejected. A fourth offer of five hundred ducats, however,
finally secured the desired privilege. Privileges were
granted in 1498, and again early in the sixteenth century,
for the printing of works in Arabic and in other Oriental
languages, but the total number of Arabic books issued
appears to have been small. Beginning with the year
1565, there are from time to time examples of publications
in Armenian. The list of musical works produced
and copyrighted during the century was large and
important.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Inquisition.</h3>
<p class="heading">—The first instance of trials undertaken
in Venice by the Holy Office for offences committed
through the printing-press, was in the year 1547.
The list is closed in 1730 with the trial of Giovanni Checcazzi.
In the sixteenth century there were one hundred
and thirty-two cases; in the seventeenth, fifty-five, and
in the eighteenth but four. It is not clear whether the
diminished activity of the Inquisition during the later
years was due to the increasingly hostile attitude taken
by the Government of Venice towards the Church of
Rome after 1596, or to the fact that the vigour of the
Press prosecutions during the last half of the sixteenth
century had effectively stamped out the publication in
Venice of heretical and immoral publications. The great
activity of these prosecutions between 1549 and 1592,
was doubtless due to the dread of the Lutheran heresy,
and of its propagation throughout Italy by means of the
printing-press.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span></p>

<p>Heretical books could be presented to the Holy Office
by denunciations submitted without signature. If the
court held that there was ground for prosecution, the
charges were formulated and the accused was directed to
appear for his defence within eight days from the publication
of the summons. The writers and the printers
of heretical books appear to have been considered about
equally guilty, while the offence of keeping such books
for sale (even though ignorance of their contents could
be shown) was also a very grave one. In the great
majority of cases, the accused allowed judgment to go by
default.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Index and the Book-Trade.</h3>
<p class="heading">—It is in connection
with the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> of Pope Clement and the
<i>Concordat</i> that the history of publishing in Venice comes
for the first time into touch with general history. The
claim of the Church to the supervision of all publications
soon became involved in the larger question of the relation
between Venice and Rome.</p></div>

<p>Paolo Sarpi, who became the champion of the cause of
the independence of the State against ecclesiastical domination,
comes into the history of literature as the upholder
of the rights of authors and of publishers against
the crushing censorship of the Inquisition. The problem
presented to the Venetian Government was: whether
the Venetian Press, supported in its liberty by the Government,
should continue to maintain its character as the
freest Press in Europe (and therefore one with the most
active production); or whether it should be permitted,
for want of the support of the Government, to fall under
the repressive influence of the Inquisition and the <i>Index</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest instance of a censorial order on the subject
of books in Venetian territory, and also in Italy, is the
order issued in 1491 by Franco, Bishop of Treviso and
Papal Legate. This decree prohibited anyone from
printing, or from causing or permitting to be printed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
any books treating of the Catholic faith or of matters
ecclesiastical, without the express permission of the
Bishop or Vicar-General of the diocese. The Legate proceeded
at once to name two works, Rosselli’s <i>Monarchia</i>
and Mirandola’s <i>Theses</i>, which were absolutely prohibited,
and all existing copies of which were to be burned in the
cathedral or in the parish churches within fifteen days
from the publication of the decree.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> There was no
charge that these works were in any way immoral or
scandalous. They were condemned simply on the
ground of the unsoundness of their doctrine. The contention
raised in this order on behalf of the Church was
far-reaching. If it were heretical to discuss, in a sense
at all hostile to the Curia, the relative powers of the
Pope and the Emperor, there would be an implied right
in the Church to censure and to condemn any political
writings in which the authority of the Pope or the responsibilities
of the Emperor were referred to.</p>

<p>It became, in fact, the keystone of the ecclesiastical
position that in the case of the Church no separation was
possible between politics and ecclesiastical dogma. The
work which had been condemned to the flames had been
dedicated to the Doge Foscari, but the Government
appears to have taken no notice of the Bishop’s decree.</p>

<p>In 1544, the University of Paris published a catalogue
of books adjudged worthy of censure, and, in 1546, the
University of Louvain issued a similar catalogue of books
which had been condemned by its Faculty of Theology.
The first Italian catalogue or index of censurable books
was that of La Casa, printed in Venice, either in 1548 or
in 1549. No copy is known to exist, and the precise
date is a matter of dispute. La Casa was the Papal
Nuncio, and his catalogue may, therefore, be considered
as the act of the Holy See, differing in this respect from
the black lists issued in Louvain and in Paris.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span></p>
<p>In 1554, the Inquisition first takes action in regard to
books, publishing a catalogue based upon that of La Casa
and the Milan <i>Index</i> of Arcimboldi. This catalogue of
the Inquisition was largely utilised for the first <i>Index</i>
issued from Rome, that of Paul IV. In the year 1558,
the Inquisition in Venice issued a decree forbidding importers
from taking any books out of bond until they had
deposited with the tribunal a full list of the books imported.
Such a list rendered, of course, comparatively
easy the subsequent seizure in the shops of any works
considered heretical or suspicious. As, under the laws
of 1562, the Inquisition had secured the right to take part
in the censorship required for the <i>imprimaturs</i>, it now
possessed supervision over all the literature supplied to
the Venetian public.</p>

<p>The first Roman <i>Index</i> was that published in 1559 by
Paul IV., under the title of: <i>Index auctorum et librorum
qui ab officio sanctæ Romanæ et universalis Inquisitionis
caveri ab omnibus et singulis in universa Christiana Republica
Mandantur.</i> The <i>Index</i> was divided into three lists:
first, the names of those authors each and all of whose
works, whether published or to be published, were absolutely
prohibited; second, names of writers certain of
whose works (the titles of which were given) were prohibited;
third, the titles of anonymous books prohibited.
At the close of the <i>Index</i> appears a list of sixty-one printers
with a prohibition of all works printed by them. In
this list there is but one Venetian name, that of Francesco
Riccioli. Throughout Italy, the <i>Index</i> was received
either coldly or with hostility. The Viceroy of Naples
and the Governor of Milan refused to allow it to be published
in their dominions. In Venice it appears never to
have been in force, while the Government of Florence
waited to see what action would be taken in other countries.
In Spain, permission to print the <i>Index</i> was refused,
and in Paris it was never published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span></p>

<p>In the year 1562, the Council of Trent turned its attention
to the question of book-trade, and, after a long discussion,
appointed a committee of eighteen members to
examine into the subject, and to draft a decree, together
with a revised <i>Index</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Tridentine Index</i> is based upon the <i>Index</i> of Paul IV.
Both devote almost their entire space to works of heresy,
giving but trifling consideration to the question of immoral
literature. The <i>Tridentine Index</i> presents ten rules for
guidance in the enlargement and continuation of the <i>Index</i>.
It introduces also the formula <i>donec corrigatur</i>. This
formula signified either a temporary or partial prohibition
of a work not absolutely condemned, or a conditional
permission for its continued sale, provided that, in all
copies of existing editions, the condemned passages were
either blotted out or corrected by pen, while in all subsequent
editions they were to be omitted or modified. The
fifth rule provided that all booksellers must have in their
shops a list of the books which they kept on sale, such
list being signed by the Inquisitor and the Bishop’s delegate;
and they were forbidden to have, to sell, or to distribute
any other books than those on said list, under
penalty of forfeiture of the books and of such other punishment
as might be ordered by the Inquisition. Under
the seventh rule, one who had imported books was forbidden
to give or to loan them for the reading of another,
or to part with them in any way without written permission.
The eighth rule provided that heirs were to submit
to the authorities a list of books inherited by them, before
using or parting with any of them. The ninth rule gave
to Bishop and Inquisitors-General the authority to forbid
within their diocese or provinces books other than those
which appeared in the <i>Index</i>. This <i>Tridentine Index</i>
appears to have been recognised at once as the authoritative
utterance of the Church on the subject of books, and
to have been very generally circulated. It was printed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
in Venice by the Aldine Press, and it was printed ten
times subsequently between 1564 and 1593. The whole
position of the censorship of the Press, as well in Venice
as in the other publishing centres of Italy, was essentially
modified through the publication of the <i>Tridentine Index</i>.
The coöperation or approval of the secular authority,
which, in Venice at least, had kept in its own hands the
nominal control of the censorship, was now disregarded;
while the powers of the Inquisition and the range of its
detailed supervision were widely extended.</p>

<p>The stringent effects of the <i>Index</i> and the <i>Rules</i> soon
made their influence felt upon the publishing and book-selling
trade throughout Europe. In 1581, the Dominican
Castiglione writes: “The Inquisitors frequently
publish orders forbidding the sale of this or that work.
The booksellers are no longer willing, therefore, to take
the risk of importing books, while they are frequently
prevented from selling those already in stock. There
must be in Rome at present unsalable books to the
amount of several thousand scudi.”</p>

<p>As early, in fact, as 1565, just after the publication of
the <i>Index</i>, Josias Simler writes: “A new <i>Index</i> has appeared
wherein so many books are condemned that a
number of professors in the Italian universities complain
they cannot lecture if the edict remains in force. Frankfort
and Zurich and other German cities have written to
the Senate of Venice, urging it not to accept an edict
whereby the book-trade will be ruined.” As a matter of
fact, the Italian book-trade with Germany was all but
destroyed, while the home book-trade was isolated and
gradually starved.</p>

<p>As it was in Venice that the importing as well as the
publishing business had been the most important, so it
was the Venetian book-trade which now suffered more
seriously than that of any other Italian city. The relations
of Venice with Germany were particularly close, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
the annals of the Frankfort as well as of the Zurich publishers
give frequent instances of works of importance
being undertaken in coöperation with Houses in Venice,
and of the division with such Houses of editions of books
which had already been printed.</p>

<p>The Venetian Government, however, accepted in full
the authority of the Council of Trent in the matter, and,
in 1567, new regulations for the book-trade were drawn
up, based upon the ten <i>Tridentine Rules</i>. From this
date, the number of Holy Office trials for offences of the
Press shows a steady increase. In the year 1571, Pope
Pius V. instituted the Congregation of the <i>Index</i> for the
purpose of dealing with all questions relating to the
examination, prohibition, or expurgation of books; and
in the year 1588, Sixtus V. ordered the Congregation
to draw up a new and enlarged edition of the <i>Tridentine
Index</i>. This contained large additions to the lists of
prohibited books, and amplified the ten <i>Rules</i> to twenty-two.</p>

<p>In 1596, appeared the <i>Clementine Index</i>, of Clement
VIII., and shortly thereafter, friction arose between
Rome and Venice in connection with the supervision of
the Press. In 1593, Maximus Margounios, a learned
Greek, who was Bishop of Cythera, was resident in Venice,
and was engaged in editing numerous Greek works
for the Venetian publishers. He had made himself obnoxious
to the authorities at Rome for certain heretical
utterances, and he was summoned to appear at the Vatican.
He declined to leave Venice and the Senate refused
to give him up. In July, 1593, Paruta, the Ambassador
of Venice at the Vatican, submitted to the Pope a vigorous
protest against the publication of the <i>Clementine
Index</i>, which was then in readiness, but which the Pope
was still keeping under advisement. Paruta set forth
before the Pope the various grounds for objection to the
proposed <i>Index:</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span></p>

<p>1st. The great commercial importance of the book-trade
in Venice, which he represented as exceeding that of any
city in Europe;</p>

<p>2d. The contention that the book-trade was in itself
worthy of protection and consideration;</p>

<p>3d. That a sufficient censorship was already exercised
by the <i>imprimaturs</i> of the Council of Ten, which were
not conceded without the <i>testamurs</i> of the examiners,
among whom was the Inquisitor;</p>

<p>4th. The fact that the publication of this <i>Index</i> would
destroy the property and might cause the ruin of many
who, believing it safe as long as they kept within the
regulations of the Council of Trent, had published books
which were now to be prohibited in the <i>Clementine
Index</i>;</p>

<p>5th. That the new <i>Index</i> not only made long additions
to the lists of prohibited books, but proposed a radical
change in the standard of prohibition. A great number
of books were now to be condemned which did not touch
at all upon ecclesiastical or religious questions, simply on
the ground of some trivial expressions having nothing to
do with dogma;</p>

<p>6th. The importance for the Church of keeping the men
of learning throughout the world well affected, and the
certainty that they would be very much troubled by any
measures which interfered with scholarly undertakings
and with the distribution of important literature.</p>

<p>Venetian publishers had interested themselves largely
in the production of non-religious books, such as editions
of the classics, the writings of the poets, and romances,
and Paruta was especially anxious to prevent this class of
publications from being interfered with, and took pains,
therefore, to emphasise that it had no importance for the
purposes of the Church. The arguments of Paruta, and
similar protests which came to Rome from Germany and
from Paris had the effect of convincing the Pope that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
some modifications in his <i>Index</i> were necessary. The
matter remained in abeyance for some four months longer,
when the <i>Index</i> was finally printed, but much altered and
diminished. Among the omissions from the first lists
were the titles of the whole class of non-religious books
printed in Venice, in behalf of which Paruta had spoken.</p>

<p>In the year 1594, Clement VIII. granted to a Venetian
publisher, Domenico Bassa, a copyright of a very comprehensive
character. It covered, in the first place, a
specific list of books (which was attached to the order),
and, secondly, all other books of which Bassa should issue
the first editions, and gave him full control of the same
for the term of ten years. Any persons infringing this
copyright were to be subjected to fines, confiscation of
their books, and excommunication. The privilege covered
territory both within and without Italy. The book-trade
of Venice petitioned the Government against the
continuance of any such privilege, contending that it was
calculated to bring immoderate gains to one man, and
that if it were fully enforced, the Venetian publishers
would be compelled either to emigrate to Rome or to
abandon their business. The Venetian Government instructed
its Ambassador, Paruta, to protest against this
extraordinary monopoly granted to Bassa, as well because
of its interference with interests of the home book-trade,
as on the broader ground that it was an assault upon the
independence of the Republic. He also contended that
there was no precedent for the use in purely lay matters
of ecclesiastical weapons.</p>

<p>The Pope replied that according to his understanding,
the copyright given to Bassa applied only to books in the
Vatican library, but that he would refer the matter to the
Congregation of the <i>Index</i>.</p>

<p>Paruta reported to his Government that Bassa was
bankrupt, and that the Venetian publishers need not fear
his competition. It was, further, his impression that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
Bassa had obtained the privilege principally as a “bluff”
to his creditors. The privilege was not recalled, but does
not appear ever to have been utilised by Bassa. Much
to the discontent of Venice, however, the precedent
remained of authority claimed if not exercised by Rome
over copyrights throughout Italy. The <i>Clementine Index</i>
was published in 1596, and, as finally framed, modified
very materially the severe regulations of the <i>Sistine Index</i>
of 1590.</p>

<p>Between the years 1564 and 1596, the Inquisitorial censorship
of books had been weighing more and more
heavily on the publishers and booksellers in Venice and
throughout Italy. The <i>Indexes</i> which had appeared since
the issue of La Casa’s Catalogue had so increased the
number of unpublishable books, many of them forming a
large staple in the trade of Venetian publishers, that the
interests of these publishers, and particularly their export
trade, had suffered severely. The attempt had been
made to take away the right of the Venetian printers
to print Bibles and missals, and to restrict the printing
of such books to Rome. The business was interfered
with for a time, but the attempt to stop it altogether was
in the end successfully resisted.</p>

<p>In spite of Paruta’s opinion that Venetian interests had
been sufficiently consulted, the printers and booksellers
at once appealed to the Senate for support against the
new <i>Index</i>. The negotiations lasted for some months,
but in the end the Pope gave way on the more important
points complained of, and a Declaration or <i>Concordat</i> was
agreed upon which lessened, as far as Venice was concerned,
the stringency of some of the more objectionable
features of the <i>Index</i>. When this <i>Concordat</i> had been
signed, the Senate authorised the publication of the
<i>Index</i>. The most important clause in the <i>Concordat</i> was
the seventh, which provided that the right of the Bishops
and Inquisitors to prohibit books which are not on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
present <i>Index</i>, should refer only to books which attacked
religion, or which were printed outside of Venice, or
which were issued with a false imprint. This right was
to be exercised only on just cause shown, and with the
consent of the three lay assessors. This limitation of the
ecclesiastical Inquisition to purely religious or theological
questions constituted a most valuable precedent in the
long fight between the Church and the secular authorities
concerning the control of the Press. The fifth clause
drew a nice distinction: Printers were forbidden to use
lascivious woodcuts, but they might use cuts which were
profane without being lascivious.</p>

<p>A few months before the arrangement of the <i>Concordat</i>,
and while the settlement was still pending, the Senate
had published a decree condemning the practice which
had begun to come into vogue among the publishers and
printers of Venice of applying to Rome for privileges and
monopolies. The Senate announced that any privileges
that had been thus obtained must be renounced or they
would be disregarded and prohibited, under penalty of a
fine of ten ducats, any future attempts to secure, either
directly or indirectly, publishing privileges from any authority
other than the officials appointed for the purpose
by the Government of the Republic.</p>

<p>The <i>Concordat</i> was the last arrangement arrived at between
Rome and Venice on the matter of the supervision
of the Press until the year 1766. During the century
and a half following the date of the <i>Concordat</i>, repeated
attempts were made by the Holy See to induce the Venetian
Government to authorise the publication of an augmented
<i>Index</i>, but the Republic had persistently refused.
The list of new prohibitions finally accepted in 1766 was
announced as <i>juxta formam concordatorum</i>.</p>

<p>The contest of 1596 gave evidence of a material change
in the attitude of Venice towards the Church since the
passing of the law of 1562. The tone of the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
had become suspicious and hostile. While it was still
ready to leave to the Church the responsibility of supervising
matters which were purely theological or dogmatic,
it objected decidedly to the attempts made by the Church
to extend its control over all classes of literature, and still
more to the tendency of the Church to utilise the censorship
of literature as a means of asserting its authority
over the State as a whole.</p>

<p>The varying phases of the long contest between the
Papacy and the other Catholic States of the world, had
of necessity an important influence upon the stability and
upon the value of literary property, and, in fact, in not a
few instances, upon its existence. When the promulgation
of a new <i>Index</i> could, without warning, stop the sale
and therefore destroy the selling value of a book or of a
series of books, the readiness of the publishers to invest
capital in literary undertakings must have been not a
little hampered, and the possibility of securing from such
undertakings any adequate returns for the authors was
much lessened.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Church to extend its control over all
literature and to enforce a general censorship which should
expurgate and, if it seemed necessary, re-shape books in
every division of thought, hampered enormously the
development of literature and of publishing not only in
Italy but in Spain and France. In Germany and in England
the Papacy was never permitted to interfere seriously
with the production or the distribution of books.</p>

<p>It was not only in Venice and in Florence that the
attempts of the Church of Rome to enlarge its control
over the Press excited active opposition. King Philip II.
had refused to permit the promulgation in Spain of the
<i>Tridentine Index</i> and its ten <i>Rules</i>. He wrote to his ambassador
at Rome that, “Spain has her own special <i>Index</i>
and her own special <i>Rules</i> on the prohibition of books.
It cannot be permitted to Rome to place her under general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
<i>orders. Books which in one country may be innocuous,</i>
in another may be dangerous.”</p>

<p>Between 1596 and 1623, the contest of Venice to retain
in the hands of its own Government the control of its
printing and publishing, continued with varying success.
The contention that it endeavoured to establish was that
the Holy Office was not and could not be a separate and
independent power in the State; but that the Inquisition
could take action in Venetian territory (in regard not
only to the censorship of books but to matters of any
kind) only through the consent of the Government.</p>

<p>The theory was that the Government could delegate
some particular function to be performed by an ecclesiastic
official, and that (even though such official should be
selected by the Church) he would, in fulfilling such function,
be an officer of the State. Under such a theory,
the idea was preserved of the independence of the State.
This view of the organisation of the censorship was preserved
under the provisions of the <i>Concordat</i>, and the
<i>Concordat</i> soon became, therefore, an object of attack by
the Church. The further contention of the Venetians
that the duties of the ecclesiastical Inquisitor should be
limited to questions of theology and dogma could be
more easily evaded by the Church, for it raised the wide
question—what is heretical? and what is the limit of
dogma?</p>

<p>In the face of many difficulties, however, the Republic
succeeded for some years in maintaining its position, and
fought hard to protect its book-trade from further burdens.
After securing the <i>Concordat</i> from an unwilling
Pope, and insisting upon the enforcing of its provisions,
it succeeded in absolutely preventing any public and
official enlargement of the <i>Index</i> within Venetian territory.
It is evident, notwithstanding, that even with the
restricted powers conceded by the <i>Concordat</i>, the <i>Index</i>,
and the Inquisition were able largely to increase the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
rigour of their censorship, and the results of their supervision
and interference were shown in the very considerable
decline in printing and publishing undertakings
immediately after 1596. Within a few months of the
publication of the <i>Index</i>, and in spite of the protection
of the <i>Concordat</i>, the presses of Venice were reduced
from one hundred and twenty-five to forty. The copyright
entries which, in 1596, had aggregated twenty-four,
amounted in 1597 to only seven.</p>

<p>It was evident that the attempts of the Republic to
protect publishing undertakings and to further literary
production had not been successful, and that the failure
was in the main due to the relation of the Venetians to
the Church. The effect of the <i>Concordat</i> in lessening the
burdens of the censorship under the <i>Index</i> was in great
part nullified by the labours of the clergy, who, for the
purpose of carrying out the policy of the Church, made full
use of the powerful instrumentality of the confessional.</p>

<p>The confessors announced to their penitents that books
condemned in Rome were prohibited for believers; and
as a rule such books, although not included in any <i>Index</i>
accepted by the Republic, could find no sale in Venice.
While other causes also contributed to the extinction of
the prestige of the Venetian Press, and to the very great
decline in its business, the chief responsibility for such
decline must rest with the Church for its persistent hostility
to the smallest measure of freedom of the Press,
and for its insistence upon restrictive measures of censorship
which were absolutely incompatible with publishing
activity and with literary production.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Interdict and Fra Paolo Sarpi.</h3>
<p class="heading">—While the contest
between Rome and Venice had turned very largely
upon questions connected with the censorship of the
Press, many other matters were involved which assumed
still larger proportions in the relations between the Church
and the Republic.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span></p>

<p>Between 1605 and 1650, a number of issues were fought
over, issues connected sometimes with the control by the
State Government of ecclesiastics accused of crimes or
misdemeanours, sometimes with the control exercised by
the Church over ecclesiastical property within the borders
of the Republic, and again with the relations of the Jesuits
and Capuchins to the law of the State. Venice was fighting
for her civil and secular independence; while the Pope
had declared his position when he announced that he
would not submit to be Pope everywhere save in Venice.
Paul addressed a <i>monitorium</i> to the clergy of Venice,
threatening excommunication to the Doge and Senate
and interdict upon the Republic. The Doge forbade the
publication of the <i>monitorium</i>, and the excommunication
and interdict came into operation.</p>

<p>While all the business of the Republic necessarily suffered,
its export trade in books was, for a time, brought
practically to a standstill. The interdict lasted for a little
more than a year, when it was finally removed under a
compromise settlement brought about through the French
Ambassador.</p>

<p>The most prominent figure in the whole of the struggle
of this period between Venice and the Papacy was Fra
Paolo Sarpi. Cleric though he were, he contended vigorously
that the Church was embarking upon a wrong
course, and he held that the State was justified in resisting,
in secular matters, ecclesiastical encroachments upon
the rights of the sovereign. In the end, notwithstanding
some temporary success on the part of the State Governments
of Italy, the Papacy succeeded in establishing
nearly all of its contentions, including a rigorous censorship
of the Press and the resulting limitations in literary
activities.</p>

<p>The fight made by Sarpi on behalf of the independence
of the State, and particularly of the right of the State to
supervise and control its literary productions was, notwithstanding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>
<i>of first importance for the intellectual</i>
activities of Europe. The arguments used in Venice
were repeated in Madrid, Paris, Zurich, and Oxford.
Time was gained for authors and for printers until, largely
by means of the presses which the Church was endeavouring
to throttle, the spirit of resistance to the domination
of the Papacy and the feeling of national independence
against the right of Rome to lay down the law for
Europe had gathered so much strength that the claims
of the Church were either withdrawn or very much
moderated.</p>

<p>In 1602, an instance occurred of censorship on the part
of the Church not for the expression of heretical opinions,
but for the omission from a work of authority of certain
passages which the Church considered to be important.
The work was a commentary by Suarez on the Tractate
<i>De Censuris</i> of Thomas Aquinas. The permission to
the booksellers Ciotto and Franceschi to print the volume
was given by the Venetian censorship only on condition
of the omission of the passages in question. The Congregation
of the <i>Index</i> at Rome thereupon forbade said
booksellers to continue the printing of the work (the publication
of which was stigmatised as a <i>crimen falsi</i>) under
penalty of excommunication.</p>

<p>The omitted passages contained attacks upon the temporal
authority of princes. Sarpi pointed out that the
formula of the <i>imprimatur</i> was unwisely worded, in that
it expressed the “approbation” of the Government for
the works issued, thus assuming on the part of the State
a practical approval of the doctrines contained in such
work. The term should, he suggested, be modified to
“with the permission.”</p>

<p>In 1611, Thomas Preston, writing under the <i>nom de
plume</i> of Roger Widdrington, published his <i>Apologia
Cardinalis Bellarmini</i>, and in 1613, his <i>Disputatio Theologica</i>.
Both works were placed on the <i>Index</i> by a special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
decree of the Congregation, <i>Nisi auctor quam primum se
purgaverit</i>.</p>

<p>The Nuncio in Venice begged that the decree might be
published and enforced upon Venetian booksellers. The
Government, acting under Sarpi’s advice, refused to
allow the prohibition to take effect in Venice, on the two
grounds that the theological doctrines taught by Widdrington
were sound and orthodox, and that his arguments
against the pernicious doctrine of the temporal
authority of the Pope over princes were eminently worthy
of dissemination. It will be noted that the Nuncio had
in his application expressly conceded one of the principal
contentions of the Republic that no Roman prohibition
was valid in Venice until confirmed by the Government.</p>

<p>In 1615, Andrea Morosini completed his History of
Venice, in which he had occasion to deal with the question
of Interdict. The Venetian Inquisition refused to
sign the <i>testamur</i>, which was requisite before the Council
of Ten could grant an <i>imprimatur</i>. Paolo Morosini, who
was in charge of his brother’s work, appealed to the Senate,
and secured a declaration to the effect that the
narrative in the History was an exact and trustworthy
account, that the Inquisitor drew his authority to act
from no other power than the Republic, that that authority
extended only to the supervision of books having to
do with questions of faith, and that no such questions
came into the History. The Government thereupon
ordered the immediate publication of the book without
the <i>testamur</i>, and with the words <i>superiorum permissu</i>.
It is to be noted that the prohibition of Rome probably
prevented the sale of the book in Italy outside of
Venice, and must, therefore, have materially lessened
the prospects of profit for author or publisher.</p>

<p>There were also instances of books which were approved
by the Church but the publication of which was
considered detrimental to the interests of the State, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
their sale in Venice was accordingly prohibited. One
book of this class was the <i>Recantation</i> of the Archbishop
of Spalato, printed in Rome in 1623, by the Apostolic
printers. The Republic objected to the contention of
the Archbishop that the Pope had power in things temporal
as well as in things spiritual.</p>

<p>A second example is the <i>History of the Council of
Trent</i>, by Cardinal Pallavicini, written in answer to Sarpi’s
History. Through the Venetian Ambassador at
Rome, Pallavicini made application for permission to sell
his book in Venice. The application was refused on the
ground that the History contained sentiments obnoxious
to the Government of the Republic.</p>

<p>In a report written to the Government by Sarpi at this
time, he takes the ground that the tendency on the part
of the Church during the past few years has produced a
whole series of books whose doctrines are entirely subversive
of all secular government. They teach that no
government but the ecclesiastical has a divine origin;
that secular government is a thing profane and tyrannical
which God permits to be imposed upon His people as a
kind of trial or persecution; that the people are not in
conscience bound to obey the secular law or to pay taxes;
that the imposts and public subventions are, for the most
part, iniquitous and unjust, and that the princes who
impose these have in many cases been excommunicated,
and that because of such excommunication of princes,
death, want, and other public misfortunes have come
upon their communities. In short, princes and rulers are
held up to view as impious and unjust; subjects may
have to obey them perforce, but, in conscience, they are
free to do all that in them lies to break their yoke.</p>

<p>Sarpi goes on to point out that the prince who had first
perceived the danger was Philip II. of Spain. The only
books that he allowed to remain under the censorship of
the Inquisition were missals, breviaries, and school-books.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
The censorship of all other literature was confided to a
commission appointed by himself. Sarpi recalls that this
had been the course taken also by the Republic, and emphasises
the importance on the part of the Republic of
retaining in its own hands a similar control of literary
censorship. Sarpi closes his report by recommending the
establishment of a code of general rules, behind which
the ducal secretary can shelter himself from the importunate,
the interested, and the over-zealous, and by means
of which a consistent censorship policy can be maintained.</p>

<p>While Sarpi’s main purpose was the maintaining the
independence of the State against the encroachments of
the Papacy, the principles for which he contended were
of first importance for the prosperity and, in fact, for the
continued existence of the Venetian publishing interest.
Unless the burden of Papal censorship could be lessened,
literary production in Venice must cease. In the schemes
submitted to the Government for a code of general rules
by which was to be directed the system of political censorship,
Sarpi specified four classes of writers whose books,
in his judgment, ought to be placed upon the <i>State
Index</i>:</p>

<p>I. Those who attack the Constitution of the Republic
and its laws by name; II. Those who attack the laws
and constitution adopted by the Republic without naming
her; III. Those who, even within the limits of fair
controversy, argue against the legislation of the State;
IV. Those who attack no laws of the State, but who
broadly maintain the absolute and universal superiority
of the ecclesiastical over the temporal authority.</p>

<p>Sarpi further contended that “In the correction of
books which are open to censure, it is not advisable to
follow the practice of the Church in raking through the
entrails of an author and altering the sense and the intention
of whole passages, so that the writer is made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
say the reverse of what he desired to say; first, because
all the world stigmatises such action as falsification; secondly,
because such conduct would bring upon Venice the
infamous charge of castrating books; thirdly, because the
Court of Rome assumes for itself the sole right to alter
passages in books.” Sarpi concludes his report by submitting
ten propositions, upon which he recommends the
Government to take action:</p>

<p>I. The <i>Index</i> of 1595, having received the consent of
the Prince, the books which appear upon it must remain
there. II. For the future, no prohibition is to be permitted
unless corroborated by public authority, as agreed
upon in the <i>Concordat</i>. III. If ecclesiastics ask civil
authorities for support in prohibition of heretical works,
it must be granted to them after the works have been
examined. IV. Under the title of heresy, dogmatical
support of civil authority in its own proper sphere, is not
to be included. V. Foreign books inimical to good government
are to be absolutely prohibited. VI. In the
reprints of books, nothing favourable to good government
is to be removed. VII. In issuing these reprints,
the old editions, before the ecclesiastical expurgations
were made, are to be used. VIII. In printing the <i>Index</i>
of 1595, no new names are to be allowed to creep in.
IX. The prohibitions of the Inquisitor shall be confined
entirely to heretical works. X. The <i>Concordat</i> shall
always be printed along with the <i>Index</i>.</p>

<p>As well from these propositions as from the general
course of the long controversy, it is evident that Venice
was, ostensibly at least, as anxious as the Church could
be for the purity of the Press. In fact, judging from the
<i>Indexes</i>, this point had not caused the Church any particular
anxiety. The unsettled question was, which should
exercise the censorship over the offences of libel, scandal,
and obscenity—the Church or the State. It was the
opinion of Sarpi that all such books should be absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
prohibited. The risk, as emphasised by Sarpi, was that
the <i>Concordat</i> might fall into desuetude, leaving the
Venetian Press completely under the control of the Inquisition
and deprived of the bulwark which the State
had secured for its defence.</p>

<p>The future justified his dread. The heat of the quarrel
died away, and the <i>Concordat</i> was substantially forgotten.
The Inquisition secured full control of the censorship.
The Press of Venice came under the influence of the
<i>Index</i> and the <i>Rules</i>. Its losses were greater than those
of the other Presses that the Council of Trent had undertaken
to regulate, for the reason that it had so much
more to lose. From the beginning of the seventeenth
century, the Venetian Printing-Press, although not destroyed,
ceases to hold preëminence in Europe.</p>

<p>In 1601, the Senate took serious alarm at the emigration
of the publishers and the printers. The latter took
with them even the materials of their trade, their type,
presses, and ink. A drastic law was at once passed making
it illegal for any printer to leave Venice without the
written authority of the Government, and prescribing
severe penalties for any who undertook to sell for export
the materials and instruments used in printing. This
measure, severe as it was, appears not to have proved
effective in checking the decline of printing, and, in 1603,
the Senate undertook a general reform of the art. The
new regulations included the following provisions:</p>

<p>None but official proof-readers were to be employed by
the printers. These proof-readers were to be appointed
by the <i>Rifformatori</i>. The manuscript copy and proofs
were to be preserved as evidence that no alterations had
been made after the examination for the <i>imprimatur</i>. A
fine of twenty-five ducats was to be imposed upon every
printer who should place the name <i>Venetia</i> on books not
printed in Venice.</p>

<p>Terms of copyright were fixed as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span></p>

<p>In the case of first editions for which the necessary <i>testamur</i>
and <i>imprimatur</i> had been secured, the publisher or
printer securing the first registry was to have a copyright
for twenty years.</p>

<p>For books printed in Italy but not in Venice, the publisher
who should secure a Venetian registry with the
Guild was to have a copyright for ten years. A similar
copyright was given for the reissue of books that had not
been printed in Venice during the preceding twenty
years. For new editions of books which had not been
printed in Venice during the preceding ten years, a copyright
of five years was to be conceded. All terms of
copyright depended upon the condition that the printing
was begun at once and was continued at the rate of not
less than half a folio a day. There was a long list of
regulations concerning the standard and quality of the
paper, ink, and type. Books which were found after publication
to be badly printed or full of typographical errors
were to forfeit their copyright.</p>

<p>The measure was a comprehensive one, and ought to
have proved of service in restoring the quality of Venetian
editions if its provisions could have been enforced.
There appears, however, to have been a lack of adequate
machinery for such enforcement.</p>

<p>It was evidently intended that the Guild should become
a sort of Stationers’ Hall for the registration of copyrights.
No such register is now in existence, and there is
some doubt as to its ever having actually been created.</p>

<p>In 1614, a new office was created in addition to the
number already charged with the supervision of the Press.
The incumbent was called the Superintendent of the
Press, and his special duty appears to have been the passing
upon the printers’ “copy” before this was put into
the hands of the typesetters. In 1653, a fresh attempt
was made to strengthen the Guild of Printers, for the purpose
as well of improving the quality of Venetian printing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
<i>as of checking the increasing importations of foreign</i>
books. The tax on imported books was raised to eight
ducats ($18) per hundred pounds.</p>

<p>In 1671, there were increasing complaints concerning
the bad workmanship and inaccurate typography of
Venetian editions, and also as to the non-delivery of the
copyright copies for the libraries of S. Mark and of
Padua. The failure to secure obedience to the various
provisions of the press-law is not to be wondered at
when we remember how complex these provisions were,
and that there was practically no police machinery to
utilise for their enforcement.</p>

<p>At the close of the seventeenth century, the following
processes had to be gone through with before a book could
be published: <i>testamur</i> from the Inquisitor; <i>testamur</i> from
the ducal secretary; certificate from the <i>Rifformatori</i> of
the University of Padua; <i>imprimatur</i> from the Chiefs of
the Ten; revision by the Superintendent of the Press;
revision by the public proof-reader; collation of the original
text with the text as printed by the secretary to the
<i>Rifformatori</i>; certificate from the librarian of S. Mark
that a copy had been deposited in the library; examination
by experts appointed by the <i>Proveditori</i> to establish
the market price of the book.</p>

<p>In connection with the majority of these operations a
fee was required. The failure to secure any one of the
several <i>testamurs</i> or <i>imprimaturs</i> delayed or indefinitely
blocked the publication of the book. This stopping of
the publication might be made necessary only after a considerable
outlay had been incurred by the publisher in
addition to the expenditure of labour and time on the
part of the author. It is not to be wondered at that
with such heavy burdens and annoying obstacles literary
production should have lessened, and publishing enterprise
and investment have been checked. It is only surprising
that under such a complex machinery of supervision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
publishing should have continued possible at all. It is
certain that the possibility of securing from the business
remunerative returns had, by the close of the seventeenth
century, very much diminished, and that there must have
been a corresponding reduction in the earnings of literary
labour. By the beginning of the seventeenth century,
the centre of literary production and of publishing activity
had been transferred from Italy to Germany, from
Venice and Rome to Zurich, Frankfort, and Leipzig.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Printers’ Guild and Press Legislation.</h3>
<p class="heading">—The
Venetian Guild of Printers and Booksellers, while nominally
given a very general control over the printing and
publishing operations in the Republic, was never in a
position to exercise so direct an effective influence over
this business as had been secured by the similar English
Guild chartered in 1556, under the name of “Stationers’
Hall.” It would appear that the printing and publishing
trade had never given the same hearty support to their
organisation as had been given to the early printers of
London. It is certain that the Guild was not well governed
by its own officers, as from year to year we find in
the records long declarations of abuses which had arisen.</p></div>

<p>Even the yearly election of officers fell into neglect,
and it sometimes happened that the same officials remained
in office, without the formality of re-election,
for six or seven years running. It was only a very
strong and thoroughly supported trade body that could
have secured for itself the right to take an active part in
coöperation with, or in antagonism to, the representatives
of the Church on the one hand or of the State on
the other, in framing the long series of regulations concerning
copyright, literary property, press supervision,
and typographical standards.</p>

<p>The Guild of Venice did not have the continued sturdiness
and self-assertion requisite for maintaining such
influence. Its principal attention was given to shaping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
new taxes and new hindrances upon the importation of
books from abroad, and to attempts, often fruitless, to
prevent the migration from Venice of the more enterprising
members of its own body. A very much larger influence
was exercised upon the Press legislation of its time
by the associated printers and publishers of Frankfort and
Leipzig, and by the well organised Printer-publishers of
Paris. The interference of the Church in the German
publishing centres was never very serious; while in Paris
the supervision of the ecclesiastics was, from the outset,
overshadowed by the controlling influence (often fussy
and bothersome) of the Parliament of Paris.</p>

<p>In spite of feeble and ineffective management, however,
the Guild of Venice accumulated property; and in
1638, it was rich enough to plan for the purchase of a
Guild Hall, which was finally opened in 1642. The hall
formed part of the cloisters attached to the Monastery of
S. John and S. Paul, and was leased in perpetuity.</p>

<p>It was apparently in keeping with the general attitude
of the Press of Italy towards the Church, that its first
headquarters should have been under an ecclesiastical
roof. The Guild of Venice was the only book-trade association
in Europe the home of which was not entirely
under secular control. Unfortunately for Venice, the
lease of these convent premises had been made in perpetuity,
and perpetual also was the obligation assumed
with the premises to perform in them each year a specific
number of masses. The expense account of the Guild
increased from year to year, and this increasing outlay
made requisite an increase in the membership list. The
number of members who belonged during the first year
of organisation appears to have been about eighty. The
average membership during the succeeding years until
1732 was from three hundred to four hundred. In this
year, the Guild took into its ranks, in addition to the
master-printers and booksellers, master-binders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span></p>

<p>In 1667, the Guild printed the examination paper prepared
for those seeking matriculation as booksellers.
This paper probably covered in substance the same range
of subjects and the same standard of proficiency as had
been in vogue for a number of years previous to its publication.
The following are the principal questions for
which answers were required:</p>

<ul>

<li class="ifrst">1st. Name the principal bibles (doubtless the principal editions of the
Bible).</li>

<li class="ifrst">2d. Name the principal Saints and Fathers, both Greek and Latin.</li>

<li class="ifrst">3d. Name the principal expositors of Holy Writ.</li>

<li class="ifrst">4th. Name the principal theologians, controversialists, and polemical
writers.</li>

<li class="ifrst">5th. Name the principal writers in ecclesiastical history.</li>

<li class="ifrst">6th. Name the ancient writers on philosophy and history; also the
principal poets, tragic as well as comic, in Greek and Latin literature.</li>

<li class="ifrst">7th. Name the principal writers on the law of nature, the law of nations,
on civil and canon law, on philosophy, metaphysics, and ethics.</li>

<li class="ifrst">8th. Name the principal geographers, Greek, Latin, Italian, and French
(the geographical science of Germany, which had already produced some of
the most trustworthy maps in existence, was apparently not appreciated).</li>

<li class="ifrst">9th. Name the principal historians, ancient and modern, letter-writers,
antiquarians, numismatists, mathematicians, physicians, surgeons, anatomists,
and jurists.</li>

<li class="ifrst">10th. Name the principal writers on the fine arts, painting, sculpture,
and architecture, civil and military.</li>

<li class="ifrst">11th. Name the principal writers on natural history and botany.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, all candidates must be able to read and write
Italian fluently, and must have a thorough knowledge of
Latin and a working knowledge of French. Greek was
not required, but was commended as a useful accomplishment.
(In the retail shop attached to the office of Aldus,
one or more salesmen had been required who could talk
intelligently to Greek scholars about their editions of the
Greek classics; but this was two hundred and thirty years
earlier.) In addition to the above series of questions on
scholarship, the examiners were instructed to make test
of the candidates’ practical knowledge of the methods
of booksellers’ business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span></p>

<p>If these examinations were carried out with any degree
of thoroughness, the booksellers of Venice must assuredly
have been entitled to rank with the scholars of the world.
We find no such high standards enforced in Paris, Leipzig,
or in London, although in the two former publishing
centres at least, the standard of scholarly attainment and
of general knowledge of literature in the book-trade has
always been high.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remark that the application of
any such severe test to the booksellers of to-day would
empty the bookshops of nearly all of the trade centres of
the world, leaving a dozen or more exceptions among
the older traders in the University towns of North
Germany.</p>

<p>The examinations for master-printers were also, if we
may trust the records, both comprehensive and thorough.
We have already seen, however, that notwithstanding
examinations and regulations, the Guild had not succeeded
in keeping Venetian printing of the seventeenth
century up to the standard established by Aldus and his
associates at the beginning of the sixteenth. In the year
1767, the <i>Rifformatori</i> turned their attention to the over-crowding
and overproduction in the book-trade, declaring
it to be their intention to regulate the supply through the
demand. The first clause of the law of July 29th forbids
the articling of new apprentices for the ensuing fifteen
years. Sons and heirs are prohibited from entering the
Guild during the lifetime of their fathers or those whom
they will succeed. No one may open a shop or establish
a press without first satisfying the magistracy that there
is room or need for such shop or press. Booksellers or
printers of the mainland who wish to enter the Guild in
Venice, must close their mainland shop or press before
they can be admitted. The copyright in new books,
which, by the law of 1603, had been fixed at twenty years’
duration is now extended to thirty years, and for reissues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
<i>it is extended from ten to thirteen years. Venetian</i>
printers must reach the market through Venetian book-sellers,
and are forbidden to sell to foreign booksellers or
to dealers in Venice not members of the Guild.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this elaborate provision, the influence
of the Guild steadily declined, and the book-trade
of Venice failed to regain its old-time prosperity. In
1780, the <i>Rifformatori</i> had before them for consideration
the treatment to be accorded to the bankrupt members of
the Guild. Insolvent members, while relieved from their
Guild taxes, were excluded from all active share in its
management. In 1782, the cashier of the Guild is empowered
to advance money to poor members who need
funds to develop their plant and to put their presses in
order. In the same year, the Government fixed a standard
of quality below which no paper used by the printer
must fall, under penalty of confiscation of the edition in
which the inferior paper was used.</p>

<p>The Guild survived the fall of the Republic in 1796,
and in March, 1799, the Provisional Government undertook
the direct control of the Press, re-affirming its
ancient provisions and regulations in the matter of licensing
books, of internal police, and of supervision. Brown
says that it is not clear whether the Guild was suppressed
or whether it died a natural death. The last document
in the minute book is dated 1806, and after that date our
knowledge ceases. It was in March, 1806, that Venice
was formally annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, as organised
by Napoleon. It is probable that any independence
of action on the part of the organisation of Printers and
Publishers was found incompatible with the Napoleonic
system of the control of the Press.</p>

<p>In summing up the history of the operations of the
book-trade of Venice, Brown remarks upon the constant
lamentation on the part of the Government that the art
of printing was decaying. He is inclined to doubt, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
whether such dread was well founded. Unquestionably
it was the case that Venice no longer held a
place of prominence for the finest class of printing, and
there were no adequate successors to Jenson, John of
Speyer, and Aldus Manutius, whose work would be
accepted by the book-lovers of Europe as a model of
typography. There was, however, a continued activity
in printing as a trade, although there might be less interest
in printing as an art, and the demand for cheap
books, as well among Venetians as among the customers
of Venice, had very largely increased between the beginning
of the seventeenth and the end of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>We find references from time to time to the rush of
competitors to republish a book the copyright of which
had expired. The long series of restrictions imposed by
the ecclesiastics upon the printing of certain classes of
books, are in themselves evidence of the extent of the
dread felt by the Church concerning the influence to be
exercised by these books upon the general public, and we
must infer that the public demand for cheap books was
steadily increasing, and that an effective book-selling and
distributing machinery had been organised. The Church
assuredly did all that was practicable to hamper the
development of the new art, and succeeded, at least to
the extent of transferring from Italy to Switzerland and
to Germany the centre of literary production and of publishing
activity.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that throughout the entire series of
Venetian laws on copyright, there is no explicit statement
that the property in a work belongs to its author. Such
a conclusion is fairly to be inferred from the sense of
many of the regulations, but it would appear that it had
been arrived at rather by implication or had been accepted
as something not necessary to define but in the nature of
a truism or a self-evident fact. If this view of the purport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
of Venetian law be sound, it follows that, in Italy at
least, literary property cannot be considered to have been
the creation of law. It is safe here to use the term Italy,
although the reference has been only to the law of Venice,
for the reason that, as far as the regulation of literary
property was concerned, Venetian legislation was much
more comprehensive and specific than that of any other
Italian State.</p>

<p>An act of the Venetian Senate passed on the 11th of
March, 1780, presents sufficient evidence that the Government
understood the ownership of a literary production
to be vested in its author. This act declares <i>il privilegio
prima d’essere perpetuo per suo posseditore, l’era per l’autore
dell’ opera, qualunque egli fosse, come si è sempre praticato</i>.
In September, 1781, the Rifformatori of the
University of Padua, in the case of Pezzani, pronounced
that <i>il privilegio accordato alla stampa diventa dovuto
premio all’ autore</i>.</p>

<p>A phrase in the decree of the <i>Rifformatori</i> of 1780
might, if taken alone, be construed as constituting or
conferring a perpetual copyright. This would, however,
not be the practical working of the decree, as the requirement
for a <i>nuova licenza colle solite forme</i> necessitated an
application for renewal every five years, and unless the
licence could be renewed, the ownership in the literary
property as such would naturally lapse. In 1789, the
question was more definitely settled by one of the laws
framed under the Provisional Government (which succeeded
the Republic), which re-enacted the provision of
the Act of 1603, whereby all books whose privileges (or
copyrights) had expired became public property.</p>

<p>A distinctive feature in all periods of the Press legislation
of Venice, was the apparent inefficiency of the law,
in spite of its constant interference and its many excellent
provisions, to correct the abuses at which it aimed. The
difficulty was partly due to the lack of adequate public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
opinion, and partly to the absence of any police machinery.
It was also the case that the legislation was probably
too paternal and unduly officious, so that the industry
became checked by a multiplicity of laws relating to every
conceivable phase of its existence. When, in addition to
the legislation which was intended to further the business
of printing and publishing, was added the complex series
of ecclesiastical censorship restrictions, it is only surprising
that any wholesome vitality for the book-trade was
possible at all.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Last Contest with Rome.</h3>
<p class="heading">—In 1765, the Senate
was again concerned with the old subject of the
deterioration of the Venetian Press. A report was presented
by the <i>Rifformatori</i> of the University from which
it appears that the number of presses had fallen from
seventy-seven in 1752 to fifty in 1765, and in which it was
contended that the quality of the printing done had suffered
as much as the quantity. In former years, said the
report, the books called for by the Italian market were
printed in Venice, and the booksellers in other cities
devoted themselves principally to keeping depots for the
sale of Venetian editions. Now, however, Leghorn,
Lucca, Parma, Modena, and Bologna print their own
books, and even refuse to accept Venetian editions in
exchange, but demand payment in money. Venice no
longer fills the place of mistress of the trade of book-production,
but has become simply a retailer.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Rifformatori</i> concluded that the evil was partly due
to the lack of a sufficiently high standard of workmanship
among the printers, but that its chief cause was the lack
of desirable new literature with which to keep the presses
occupied. The demand for reissues of the classics had
been in great part supplied, while the production of original
works had been seriously hampered and discouraged
by the continuous interference of the Church and the
serious obstacles and burdens imposed through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
<i>Indexes</i>, the <i>Rules</i>, and the cumbersome machinery of
the ecclesiastical censorship.</p>

<p>The <i>Rifformatori</i> recommended, among other measures,
that the <i>Concordat</i> and the <i>Index</i> of 1595 should
again be published, if only to prove that all works subsequently
placed upon the <i>Index</i> without the consent of the
Government were not prohibited in Venice but could be
freely printed, bought, and sold; that the name of Venice
should be printed on the title-pages of all Venetian
productions; that printers and publishers should be forbidden
to seek the <i>testamur</i> of the Inquisitor for the
reissue in Venice of books first printed abroad, but that
these works should be licensed directly by the Government
after an examination of them by certain faithful and
learned persons. It was evidently the object of the
<i>Rifformatori</i> to secure for the Venetian Press the large
business of supplying the markets of Italy with editions
of works by foreign authors, the literary activity of Italy
being at that time evidently insufficient to keep the
printers occupied.</p>

<p>The recommendation of the <i>Rifformatori</i> that the
censorship privilege heretofore exercised by the ecclesiastical
Inquisitor should be brought to an end was certain,
if adopted, to bring the Republic into renewed conflict
with the Church.</p>

<p>This recommendation, however, together with all the
others in the report, were passed upon with approval by the
local advisers of the Senate. In August, 1765, the Senate
issued a decree instructing the <i>Rifformatori</i> to publish
and to circulate the <i>Index</i> of Clement and the <i>Concordat</i>,
and also providing that the Rifformatori should appoint
an ecclesiastic, a subject of Venice, as an equal associate
with the Inquisitor, whose <i>testamur</i> as to matters of faith
and doctrine should have equal weight with that of the
Inquisitor. The publication of this decree caused no
little excitement in Rome,—and a decree was at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
issued by the Papal Court prohibiting the sale or circulation
of all books licensed by the newly-appointed Venetian
officers. Any such books found on the frontier of
the Papal States were to be seized and consigned to that
part of the convent libraries known as the “prison and
hell of heretics.” In July, 1766, the Papal Nuncio made
a formal protest to the Government of the Republic and
demanded the withdrawal of the decree of 1765.</p>

<p>The issue between the Republic and the Papacy was
not whether heretical publications should be repressed,
for Venice declared itself as much opposed as Rome to
books destructive of sound doctrine. The contest turned
upon the selection of the authority that should decide
what was heretical or dangerous. The Republic had
from the outset claimed that all authority for censorship
and for licensing must proceed from the Church, and
while it was prepared to make use of ecclesiastical censors,
these must be appointed by the civil government. The
present decree expressed, it was contended, merely a
reaffirming of the original policy. The Papacy, on the
other hand, maintained that the authority of the Holy
Writ, of the Fathers, and of the Councils proved that the
duty of keeping the flock from poisonous food was entrusted
to the Church.</p>

<p>The Senate referred the demand of the Papacy to Pietro
Francheschi for counsel, and he prepared a report in
which the case of the State was forcibly stated. The
position of Venice had, it was contended, not changed at
all from the time when, with the introduction of printing,
some system of Press supervision had been found to be
necessary. She still claims to be the faithful child of the
Church, while maintaining her right also to be <i>Principe
libero in casa sua</i>.</p>

<p>The issue had thus been fairly presented on the part
of the two parties but no conclusion was reached, and it
is probable that with such different points of view, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
with a lack of accord even upon such primary terms as
“dogma,” “heresy,” and “orthodoxy,” no agreement
that was both logical and equitable could have been
reached, even if more time had been available for the
discussion. The decree of August, 1765, was never
withdrawn, and the place of Inquisitor as censor of books
upon matters of faith was taken by persons appointed by
the <i>Rifformatori</i> of the University. In the year 1794,
the Commissioners of Heresy (<i>Savii sopra l’Eresia</i>)
requested an opinion from these University censors
upon the <i>Institutiones Theologicæ</i> of De Montazet, Archbishop
of Lyons, which had been censured at Rome in
1792. As a result of their report, the Government refused
to sanction the decree of the Congregation of the <i>Index</i>.</p>

<p>Such an instance can be accepted as evidence that the
Press of Venice had at last secured freedom from the
censorship of Rome. The revolutionary spirit which was
agitating all Europe, and which in France had for the
time completely overthrown both Church and monarchy,
must have seriously weakened the control of the Papacy
over the Italian States, and doubtless exercised no little
influence in this final contest between the ecclesiastical
censorship and the printing-press.</p>

<p>Venice did not long enjoy this freedom. In 1797, the
Republic fell, and with the establishment of French rule,
the history of Venetian legislation concerning literary
property comes to an end.</p>

<p>This record of the Venetian Printing-Press, including
its relations with the Government, the Church, and the
public, covers, as we have seen, a period of about three
centuries, from 1490 to 1797. It is, as said, based upon,
and in part abstracted from, the erudite and comprehensive
history of Brown. I have thought best to confine
the narrative to Venice on several grounds. Venice was
the first city in Italy, and practically the first in Europe,
in which the printing and publishing business became of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
importance. For the first century of the period above
referred to, it was the chief publishing centre of the
world. In Venice, came together skilled printers from
Germany and learned scholars from the ruins of the
Eastern Empire, and the development of the Venetian
Press was encouraged and in part made possible by the
support of certain cultivated members of the Italian
nobility, a nobility which, during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, probably possessed a greater measure of
intellectual refinement and scholarly taste than could be
shown at the time by the noble classes of any other
country of Europe.</p>

<p>The comparatively secluded position of Venice preserved
it from many of the interruptions of foreign invasions
and interstate strifes to which nearly all the other
cities of Italy were subject. All classes of business were
of necessity seriously interfered with, and often for the
time entirely destroyed by the desolating influence of
war in the form either of defensive campaigns against
Germany, France, or Spain, or of the many little contests
of the cities with each other; while for literary activity
and for the production and distribution of books, conditions
of warfare were nearly fatal. It is surprising that
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it should
have proved possible to have carried on as much book
business as was done in such cities as Lucca, Florence,
and Pisa.</p>

<p>During these centuries, however, Venice, protected by
her lagoons, never felt the foot of an invader, and while
her trade through Italy had to take its share of the interruptions
caused by the many wars, her traffic by sea was
rarely interfered with. It was doubtless in part also this
position of independence which enabled Venice to withstand
the encroachments of the Papacy, and alone among
Italian cities to preserve in its own hands even a partial
control of its Press. This Press was, of course, very far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
from being free, the censorship on the part of the State,
and the ecclesiastical censorship exercised either by
authority of or in spite of the authority of the State,
being often severe, and always cumbersome, irritating,
and expensive, and interfering enormously with the value
of literary production as property. The Venetian Press
possessed, however, a far greater measure of freedom
than had been secured by the printer-publishers of any
other Italian city, and this was probably the chief cause
of its long-continued preëminence.</p>

<p>The general course of the legislation in Venice for the
supervision of the Press and for the encouragement and
protection of literary workers and of publishers, was
similar in character to that of the other Italian cities in
which attention was given to printing. The literary
legislation of Venice was, however, more comprehensive
in its character and more consistent in its purposes than
that of other Italian States, while the records of it are
also among the most complete, and, thanks to the
scholarly diligence of Mr. Brown, are now accessible to
the unscholarly reader.</p>

<p>This abstract of the history of the Venetian Printing-Press
has, therefore, been given as presenting a sketch of
the history of literary property in Italy for the three centuries
covering the period from the introduction of printing
to the destruction of the Venetian Republic.</p>

<p>The enactments in Italy relating to literary property
are not again of any very distinctive importance until
after the establishing, in 1859, of the Italian Kingdom.</p>

<p class="center">PRIVILEGES AND REGULATIONS IN GERMANY.</p>

<p class="center">1450-1698.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">FROM the time of the invention of printing, about
1450, to the end of the fifteenth century, the
works of living authors played practically no part
in the German book-trade, and the question of commercial
results for their writers did not call for consideration.
The printers and publishers of this period busied themselves
almost exclusively in putting into print the manuscripts
of the earlier ages. In this class of undertakings
the principal task was to secure through the collation of
different manuscripts an authoritative and trustworthy
text, and the literary service required was not that of an
author but of an editor. It is the contention of Schurmann
and of other German historians that in the folio
and quarto reprints of the fifteenth century German printers
took the lead, and that their preëminence was hardly
contested by the other printers of Europe until the time
of the Reformation. This view, however, fails to do justice
to the importance of the scholarly labours of Aldus
of Venice, who was unquestionably the leading publisher
of the fifteenth and early sixteenth century. As
previously pointed out, Luther was probably the first
German author to draw attention to the iniquity of literary
piracy, and to prophesy the evils that must result to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
the development of German literature unless legislation
could be secured that would make a substantial recognition
of the property rights of literary producers. He
took the ground that such recognition could not be adequately
given by the system of privileges, the tendency
of which was to narrow instead of to widen the conception
of literary property. He emphasised also the right
of the author to come into direct relations with his
reader, and by means of his personal control of all the
editions circulated of his works to preserve his text from
corruption (<i>Text-Verfälschung</i>) and to have the assurance
that the words that came to the reader were the words
that had originally been written by the author.</p>

<p>Luther’s interest in this question of the correctness of
the text was, in fact, much keener than in regard to the
remuneration of the author, and he was even ready to
give his aid to unauthorised issues of his own writings by
correcting the proofs of the same. The accuracy of the
text was, of course, of special importance in connection
with the vital subjects which Luther was presenting to
the attention of his readers, and was also the more difficult
of attainment on account of the material differences
at that time existing between the dialects of North and
South Germany.</p>

<p>He writes in 1524: “<i>Des falschen Druckens und Bücherverderbens
fleissingen sich jetzt viele</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> (There are many
now busying themselves with the spoiling of books
through misprinting them.)</p>

<p>Literary piracy in Germany may be said to have begun
almost at once with the invention of printing. Before
manuscript copies had been replaced by printed books,
the possession of a manuscript was held to carry with it
the right to make copies of the same <i>ad libitum</i>. As a
very natural, though hardly warranted consequence of
this practice, the possession of a printed copy of a work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>was for a considerable time also believed to carry with it
the right to make and to dispose of further printed copies,
and the first upholders of an author’s copyright found
themselves obliged to contend against the claim of
“ancient precedent.”</p>

<p>Early in the history of the German book-trade, there
arose a practice among leading publishers of respecting
each other’s undertakings, irrespective of any privileges
or other legal protection given to the works in question.
To this practice there were, of course, numerous exceptions,
but it exercised nevertheless, during the period
previous to the existence of national copyright systems,
an important influence in educating trade opinion and
public opinion to a recognition of and a respect for literary
property. The many important publications of
Anthoni Koberger of Nuremberg, whose business activity
dated from 1473, were issued entirely without privilege,
and appear, with a few exceptions, not to have been interfered
with by rival publishers. He took pains to
protect himself by giving to those publishers whose competition
was most likely to be serious, shares in his more
important ventures. In 1495, for instance, he entered
into a compact with Nicholas Kessler, of Basel, under
which each agreed not to interfere or to compete in any
way with works undertaken by the other.</p>

<p>The works of Albert Dürer, both in art and in literature,
afford early examples of the attempts of local governments
to secure protection for copyrights. In 1512,
complaint was made to the Magistracy of Nuremberg that
a certain man was offering for sale some prints or drawings
which pretended to be the work of Dürer and which
bore Dürer’s signature, but that both the designs and the
signatures were counterfeits. Thausing<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> is of opinion
that it was only the forgery of the signatures that was
complained of, but Schurmann appears to believe that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>there had been an attempt also to imitate Dürer’s work.
The decision of the magistrates was that the sale of these
prints must be stopped, and that the copies remaining
which bore the fraudulent signature must be confiscated.
In 1532, some time after the death of Dürer, a certain
Hans Guldemund re-engraved the <i>Triomph-wagen</i>, and
began to sell impressions from this unauthorised plate.
The magistrates, upon being appealed to by Dürer’s
widow, promptly forbade Guldemund to make any further
sales. The latter evidently delayed giving obedience
to the order, and this was accordingly re-affirmed
two weeks later.</p>

<p>Dürer’s <i>Instruction in Perspective</i>, first published in
1525, appeared in Paris in a Latin translation in 1532, and
copies of this Paris edition shortly found their way into
sale in Nuremberg and in other German cities. Dürer’s
widow, who had, in 1528, secured an imperial privilege
for her husband’s writings, made complaint of these unauthorised
sales, and, in October, 1532, the magistrates
of Nuremberg summoned all the booksellers of the town
and cautioned them against keeping in stock or selling
any copies of the unauthorised editions. On the same
day, copies of this Nuremberg order were sent to the
magistrates of Strasburg, Frankfort, Leipzig, and Antwerp,
with the request that similar orders should be issued
in those cities for the protection of Dürer’s works. It
does not appear for how long a term the widow succeeded
in protecting these copyrights either in Nuremberg or
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The last case in which the infringement of Dürer’s
works came into question presents an instance of a larger
claim for the protection of an author’s idea than would
be accepted under modern copyright law. Dürer’s treatise
on <i>Proportion</i> was being put into print in Nuremberg
by Hieronymus Andreä. It became known, however,
that Andreä, in conjunction with a painter named Beham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
himself had in preparation a work on the subject of <i>Proportion</i>,
and in July, 1528, the magistrates of Nuremberg
issued an edict forbidding these two authors from proceeding
with the publication of their volume (which must,
he saw fit to assume, have been based upon the labours
of Dürer) until the publication of the authentic work (<i>das
rechte Werk</i>) had been completed. Beham protested that
his volume was entirely original and quite distinct in its
plan from that of Dürer. The magistrates, however, took
the ground that the idea or plan of a treatise on this
subject had originated with Dürer, and that Dürer’s
heirs were entitled to be protected against any attempt
to diminish (by means of such advance competition) the
commercial value of such plan. Beham was obliged to
content himself by publishing at this time that part of
his work only which had to do with the subject of <i>Proportion
in Horses</i>. His chapters on <i>Proportion in the
Human Figure</i> were held in manuscript until 1546, when
they were printed in book form in Frankfort. The completion
of his publication showed that he had been entirely
correct in his contention that he had not borrowed in any
way from the material left by Dürer. The magistrates
themselves do not appear to have adhered to their original
charge that Andreä and Beham were pirating Dürer’s
work, or they would, instead of simply prohibiting their
publication until the Dürer book was in the market,
have enjoined its publication altogether as a plagiarism
or infringement. They seem simply to have convinced
themselves that Dürer’s wife and other heirs were entitled
to the first fruits of any profits that could be secured from
the subject of <i>Proportion</i>, on the ground that Dürer was
the first author to give attention to this subject.</p>

<p>In certain special instances, such as the above, local
pride in an author of fame, and personal interest on the
part of the magistrates, served to bring about a special
protection for literary productions. It appears, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
that German authors could not, as a rule, depend upon
securing even a local protection for their works simply on
the ground of prior publication, as it is from this time,
namely the first third of the sixteenth century, that special
privileges begin to make their appearance.</p>

<p>Under an order of the <i>Rath</i> of the city of Basel, issued
in October, 1531, printers of books in that city were
enjoined from reprinting or pirating the books of each
other, for a term of three years after the first publication
of such books, under a penalty of one hundred guldens.
Schurmann understands that this and similar local ordinances
had no reference to the protection of new works by
contemporary writers, but were designed simply to prevent
unprofitable competition in connection with new
editions of standard or classical works. If a printer or
publisher issued an edition of a book belonging to this
class, he was to be protected for a term of three years,
within the territory of the municipality, against the competition
of other editions (whether better or poorer, dearer
or cheaper) of the same book.</p>

<p>As far as new and original works were concerned, it
appears as if the possession of a copy, or at least of a
copy in manuscript form, was held to carry with it the
right to reproduce. This right there were in any case,
until the middle of the eighteenth century, practical difficulties
in the way of gainsaying for rival reproductions
which were not put into print within the same municipality.
It was only with the organisation of the book-trade
in the middle of the eighteenth century and the
establishment in Frankfort and Leipzig of the Book-Fairs
with their systems of book-exchanges, that there began
to be any systematic efforts to protect literary and publishing
undertakings over the territory covered by the
book-trade of the empire.</p>

<p>Until nearly the end of the eighteenth century, the
protection of literary property in Germany depended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
upon the system of privileges, imperial or local; but
these privileges were, for the most part, concerned simply
with the property interests of the publishers and printers,
only a small proportion of them having to do with modern
books or with the rights of living authors. Such
privileges covered, at the outset, three classes of literary
undertakings: first, official publications, a term including
in the earlier times the service books of the Church and
school text-books as well as the authorised text of government
edicts, laws, and announcements; secondly,
editions of works taken from the body of the world’s
literature (<i>literärisches Gemeingut</i>), <i>i.e.</i>, the first printing
(<i>Vordrück</i>) of the same; and third, new works presenting
a first consideration of a specific subject, more particularly
of a subject of a scientific, technical, or practical nature.
For this last class of undertakings, the recipient of the
privilege claimed a control not only of the specific book
which he had produced or of which he was the owner,
but a monopoly for the time being, within the district
covered by the privilege, of the subject considered in
such book.</p>

<p>The writer who had, for instance, produced a book on
the <i>Use of Herbs</i>, or the publisher who had employed a
writer to prepare such a book (the subject not having
been treated before, or at least not recently) would consider
himself aggrieved and would contend that his rights
had been infringed, if the publication within the same
territory of another book on herbs should be permitted.
If the privilege covered an edition of a Latin author, the
holder believed himself authorised to prevent the publication
within the territory covered by his privilege of
any other edition of the same author, even although
such competing edition might, in respect to the revision
of the text and to the editorial work in the notes and
commentaries, be entirely distinct from his own.</p>

<p>Local privileges of this kind, which undertook to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
to the possessor an exclusive control for a certain term
of a specific classic text, were, of course, practically identical
with the trade monopolies, also characteristic of the
age, which were conceded for the sale, within certain
territories, of articles of assured commercial value, such
as salt or wool. Such privileges can hardly be classed
with copyrights.</p>

<p>Local privileges came, before long, to be divided into
two classes, the one entitled privileges “for works” or
“for books,” and the other “for writers” or “for authors.”
The Frankfort ordinance of 1660 distinguishes
between <i>Bücher</i> and <i>Autores</i>. The <i>Tractatus de typographis</i>,
<i>bibliopolis</i>, etc., of Fitsch, published in 1675,
speaks of privileges for <i>libros et scriptores</i>, and again for
<i>autores et libros</i>. The earliest German privilege of which
there is trustworthy record was issued in 1501 by the
Imperial Council, not to an individual, but to an association
entitled the <i>Sodalitas Rhenana Celtica</i> (Rhenish Celtic
Society) for the publication of an edition of the dramas
of Hroswitha of Gandersheim, which had been prepared
for the Press by Conrad Celtes. These dramas had been
written about 985. This Hroswitha privilege, while
later than the early Venice privileges, antedates by two
years the first instance in France, and by seventeen years,
the first in England. After 1501, there is a long series of
imperial privileges issued directly by the Imperial Chancellor
in the name of the Emperor. One of the earlier
of these was given for <i>Lectura aurea semper Domini Abbatis
antiqui super quinque libris decretalium</i>, in 1510, a
work printed by Johann Schott. In 1512, an imperial
privilege was issued to the historiographer, John Stadius,
for all that he should print, the first European privilege
which was made to cover more than a single work or which
undertook to protect books not yet published. I find no
record in Germany of any privileges similar to those cited in
Venice, for a whole class of works, or for an entire language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span></p>

<p>An imperial patent of 1685 uses the terms (as if in
antithesis to each other) “A privileged book,” and “A
book purchased from its author” (<i>vom Authore mit Kösten
erhandelten Buch</i>). Later, we find references to
“privileged” and “non-privileged” books, under the
latter being understood original works by contemporary
writers. Pütter (who may be called the father of the
modern theory of property in literary productions), writing
in 1764, uses for the unprivileged books the term
<i>eigenthumlich</i> (individual), and for the privileged the term
<i>nicht-eigenthumlich</i> (non-individual).</p>

<p>It is to be inferred from such examples that it was customary
to secure privileges only for reissues of old books
(which reissues might, of course, and usually did, constitute
the first publication for Germany), or for a monopoly
of some special subject. For original works by living
writers (except in connection with a claim to control the
subject) privileges were apparently not, as a rule, thought
to be necessary or to add materially to the protection of
the author’s rights. The practice in different States and
in different cities, however, evidently varied very considerably,
and there must have been no little uncertainty
and confusion from the conflicting claims of authors, publishers,
and printers undertaking to control in several
States the sales of books for which privileges had been
secured in but one.</p>

<p>Pütter is of opinion<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> that the purpose of authors in
securing privileges was at this time not so much to protect
themselves from piracy as to prevent or impede competition.
In no other way, as he contends, can well be
explained the short terms (six, three, and even two years)
for which these privileges to authors were issued, as it is
evident that they could not have expected to sacrifice
their authors’ rights or, as we should now say, their copyrights,
at the expiration of such terms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span></p>
<p>Schurmann concludes that the system of privileges had,
in fact, little connection with the recognition or the protection
of the rights of authors as producers (such rights
as English authors were about this time beginning to
claim under the common law). The advantage secured
by an author under a privilege was, on the one hand, a
certain monopoly (usually, of course, for a limited territory
as well as for a limited term), and on the other, a
simpler and more effective method of controlling or protecting
his books than that afforded by the system of
proceedings under the law.</p>

<p>The possessor of an imperial privilege was, at least
nominally, in a position to enforce penalties against an
unauthorised reprinter in any portion of the empire, and
without reference to the local authorities, the principal
limitation on such action being the difficulties not infrequently
placed in his way by local officials who happened
not to be well disposed towards the imperial authority.
At the Frankfort Fair, however, which soon came to be
recognised as the central and controlling organisation and
exchange not only of the German but of the European
book-trade, an imperial privilege was usually accepted as
of valid and adequate authority.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such recognition of imperial authority,
the records of German publishing during the last half
of the seventeenth century and the first portion of the
eighteenth are full of complaints of piracies and of contentions
concerning the control of literary property.</p>

<p>The purpose and the effect of the imperial privilege
system would not be rightly estimated if we failed to
remember that they were intended to secure an imperial
supervision of literary production no less than an assured
foundation for the business of publishing books. No
works could secure an imperial privilege that had not first
received the approval of the censors in charge of the district
in which the book was printed. In case the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
concerned itself with political affairs, the censorship was
usually referred directly to certain imperial councillors in
Vienna (<i>Reichshofrath</i>). Sometimes the imperial censors
found it necessary to override the authority of the local
examiners and to revoke their authorisations. In 1777,
the Berlin publisher Nicolai secured a privilege for the
publication of <i>The Life and Opinions of Johann Burkels</i>.
The year following, the privilege was cancelled from
Vienna, on the ground that it had been obtained surreptitiously
and with the connivance of certain Prussian
censors who were in sympathy with “the gross errors of
the Arians and Socinians.” The circulation of the work
within the Holy Roman Empire was at the same time
prohibited.</p>

<p>The grounds upon which the imperial authority claimed
the right to supervise the literary productions of the realm
are not quite clear. In an official document of 1780,
occurs the phrase, “The regulation of books (<i>das Bücher-regal</i>)
which has for many years been within the control
of the Emperor.” In a memoir addressed to the Emperor,
in 1762, by the imperial <i>Hofrath</i>, the former is
referred to as the tribunal in which from the beginning of
the sixteenth century have been vested the control and
supervision of the literature produced within the realm.</p>

<p>Schurmann is of opinion that the authority for the
regulation of books (<i>Bücher-regal</i>) was derived from or
connected with the rights reserved to the imperial authority
under the Golden Bull. To these rights belonged
the control of the final judicial appeal, and the issue and
supervision of all claim of privileges. A century after the
issue of the Golden Bull, at the time of the invention of
printing, the reserved powers (<i>Reserva-rechte</i>) of the empire
had become materially weakened, and were being in
large part exercised by local authorities, and the attempt
of the Emperor to enforce control over literary production
and distribution, now becoming of such extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
importance, was from the outset met by no little antagonism
and protest on the part of princes and municipal
magistracies.</p>

<p>The contention of these latter that the control of this
new department of industry and production rested properly
with them, was strengthened by the fact that the
business of book-publishing was of necessity dependent
upon the printing-presses, and the right to license and to
protect the presses had never been included in the imperial
powers, but had from the outset been exercised by
the princes or magistrates. An evidence of this local
control of the presses is afforded by the form (in use from
the earliest times) of the oath which had to be taken by
all printers working under such local licenses. This
oath, while making due recognition of the local authority
under which the licence was issued, bound the printers
also to an observance of the imperial enactments. The
requirement of the local licences was, however, evidently
not universal, for we hear of certain “corner printing-offices”
(<i>Winkel-drückereien</i>) which appear to have
worked outside of any local control.</p>

<p>The attempts of the imperial authority to secure an
imperial supervision over the literary output of the realm,
were to some extent confused and interfered with by the
contention of the Church that such supervision properly
belonged to her. The Archbishop of Mayence, who was
also the Chancellor of the Empire, was especially active in
enforcing an ecclesiastical censorship over all the presses
and publishing concerns within his diocese, which happened
to include the most important of the earlier centres
of publishing enterprise. His example was followed by
other bishops throughout the empire, and the records
show that such ecclesiastical censorship was exercised
from the several diocesan capitals and also from such <span class ="err" title="original: Unievrsities">Universities</span>
as those of Cologne, Trèves (Trier), and Leipzig.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span></p>
<p>The emperors were not likely to accept with patience
this clerical interference with a domain regarded as their
own, and, in 1455, Frederick III. appointed Doctor Jacob
Össler to the post of imperial supervisor of literature and
superintendent of printing, an appointment which was
confirmed by Frederick’s successor, Maximilian I. Össler
was a jurist, but his censorship included the control of
theological literature, as if it were the intention of the
Emperor to emphasise the authority of the lay power as
against the pretensions of the Church. The headquarters
of the imperial superintendent of literature were placed
in Strasburg, which was at the time the most important
town in the empire for printing and for bookselling.</p>

<p>In 1512, a so-called “privilege,” one of the earliest,
was issued by the Emperor Maximilian I. to Johann Stab
in Lintz, “historiographer and cartographer.” It covered
“all works” which he “might cause to be printed.”
It is the understanding of Kapp, however, that this authorisation
is to be understood not as a privilege but as
an appointment to the office of “supervisor of books.”
The records contain the titles of a number of books,
engravings, and charts as having been issued under the
authority and with the name (imprint?) of the historiographer,
with permissions or licences protecting them
against competition for the term of ten years. It appears,
further, that he had the power to shorten this term
of protection, and to declare the works open to reprinting
within a shorter period than ten years. The privileges
thus controlled by Stab were for “books,” not for
“authors,” and can probably, therefore, be understood
as having to do only with material which was not the
production of contemporary writers. There is nothing
to show what range of territory was covered by Stab’s
supervisorship, or whether this may be considered as having
possessed equal authority with that of Össler, or as
having been subordinated to this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Jacob Spiegel, secretary to the Emperor, appears
also to have exercised, between the dates of 1515-1520,
the functions of a supervisor or censor of literature, and
the stamp of his official approval is found on several books
of the time. On the <i>Germania</i> of Æneas Sylvius (afterwards
Pius II.), originally issued in Italy in 1464, and
printed for the first time in Germany in 1515, by R. Beck
of Strasburg, the form of approval or privilege is worded
as follows: <i>Per Cesarem. Ad Mandatum Cesaris Majest.
proprium Jacob Spiegel.</i></p>

<p>The question has been raised as to why the decrees of
the imperial Diet contain no references to the imperial
control of book-publishing. Schurmann explains this
omission on the ground that such control was exercised
as a personal right of the Emperor. In 1495, a time
when under the leadership of Berthold, Elector of Mayence,
a concerted effort was made on the part of the electors
and princes to limit in various respects the authority
and privileges of the imperial Crown, the contention saw
made (quite in the spirit of the eighteenth century) that
the princes and those deputed by them for the task, were
much better able than the Emperor could be, to judge
for their several domains what books should be permitted
and what should be forbidden.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the privilege issued
in 1501, for an edition of the dramas of the nun Hroswitha.
Hroswitha, or Helena von Rossow, was a nun of
the Benedictine convent of Gandersheim, who had died
nearly six hundred years before. Her literary work is
referred to in an earlier chapter. The privilege to Celtes
was, therefore, in the nature of a monopoly for material
which, in the absence of such privilege, would have
remained common property. This privilege is of interest
as indicating that at the time it was issued the imperial
authority over literary property was recognised by the
States and municipalities of Germany as extending only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>
over the imperial cities (<i>Reichsstädte</i>). Even to this control
there was a noteworthy exception, as Frankfort,
which in connection with its Book-Fair was becoming
each year of greater importance as a centre of the book-trade,
was apparently not included in the territory covered
by an imperial privilege, and its magistracy had
retained the right to issue privileges on its own account.
We find, therefore, that Celtes, in this same year, 1501,
secured a privilege for his book from the Magistracy of
Frankfort.</p>

<p>Schurmann draws a distinction between the imperial
privileges which emanated directly from Vienna, and
those issued in Nuremberg and elsewhere under the authority
of the <i>Reichsregiment</i>, or imperial Diet, and says
that well authenticated instances of the former class
begin only with the year 1510, and that for the succeeding
half century the number issued was but inconsiderable.</p>

<p>It was only after 1569, when the imperial commission
was appointed to supervise the operations of the Book-Fair
at Frankfort, that the imperial privileges became
numerous and important. The small part taken by the
imperial authority during this half century in the supervision
of literature appears to have been due to the fact
that in the particular districts where book-publishing was
most active there was the greater unwillingness to recognise
that its control properly belonged within the functions
of the Emperor. Under the imperial decrees of
Nuremberg, in 1524, of Speyer, in 1529, and of Augsburg,
in 1530, the contention of the Emperor to control
as a personal function of the Crown the whole business
of printing and publishing, was replaced by an arrangement
under which the immediate supervision of the printing-presses
was left to the local or state governments,
while the imperial authority provided (through magistrates
appointed for the purpose) a final court of appeal.</p>

<p>After the battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, the claims of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
the Emperor to the full control of nearly all divisions of
government were asserted with fresh vigour and persistency,
and, in 1548, an imperial edict was issued placing
the presses of the empire under strict police supervision,
especially with reference to any publications which had
to do with ecclesiastical matters. There continued, however,
to be more or less confusion in connection with the
exact bearing of the imperial enactments concerning literary
property, and these enactments were very far from
securing any general obedience. There was also no little
counterfeiting and falsification of the imperial privileges.</p>

<p>On this ground, Maximilian II., in 1569, called upon
the Magistracy of Frankfort to establish or to enforce
better police regulations for the protection of privileged
books, and for the prevention of the publication of books
that had not been inspected and licensed. The magistracy
endeavoured to free the city from the responsibility
of such a task, and requested the Emperor to send to
Frankfort some scholarly commissioners to take charge
of the proposed supervision. This request was fulfilled,
in 1579, by Rudolph II., who directed the clerk of the
imperial Court and the Dean of the Frankfort Convent
to serve as the first members of such commission.</p>

<p>This imperial commission, working in Frankfort, exercised
an influence over all the book-trade of which
Frankfort was the centre. Its operations were very
largely controlled by the interests, real or imaginary, of
the Catholic Church, and the oppressive supervision and
arbitrary censorship which resulted had not a little to do
with the discouraging of literary undertakings in Frankfort
and with the transfer of publishing enterprise and of
the business of book distribution to Protestant Leipzig.</p>

<p>With the growth of Leipzig as a book-producing and
book-selling centre, the privileges issued in the Electorate
of Saxony assume an increasing importance, and
from 1598 we find that these electoral privileges are being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>
largely secured by publishers throughout Germany. A
commission was appointed by the Elector to take the supervision
of the Book-Fair, and the literary responsibilities
of this electoral commission very soon largely exceeded
those of the imperial commission sitting in Frankfort,
the more particularly as, after 1627, an imperial privilege,
unless confirmed by the Leipzig commission, was very
frequently disregarded altogether by the Leipzig book-dealers.
While the imperial and the Saxon privileges are,
in connection of course with their influence upon the
book-trade of Frankfort and of Leipzig, the best known
and the most frequently referred to in the history of literary
production in Germany, the encouragement given
to the trade of printing and publishing by certain so-called
“particular” privileges must not be lost sight of.
An early example of this class was the “Letter of aid
and protection” (<i>Schirm und Versprech-brief</i>) which the
Elector Frederic I., as Landgrave of Alsace, in 1466, gave
to master Heinrich Eckstein, “for the purpose of furthering
his good trade of printing,” ecclesiastical and lay protection
by water and by land. A more comprehensive and
more “particular” privilege was that previously referred
to which had been issued, in 1469, by the Senate of Venice
to the German printer, Johann von Speyer (Johann de
Spira), under which was given, for the term of ten years,
the exclusive right to do printing within the Venetian
dominions.</p>

<p>Throughout the German realm, this form of the protection
or encouragement of book-production appears to
have been exercised chiefly by the imperial cities. There
was evidently among the earlier German publishers a
good deal of dependence upon what would now be called
the courtesy of the trade, an understanding under which
the publishers or printers in any one State, or at least in
any one town, would refrain from interference with each
other’s undertakings. This understanding or arrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>
was, however, assisted by the short-term privileges,
a protection already referred to issued by the municipalities,
or their magistrates, and forbidding interference for
periods ranging from six months to five years.</p>

<p>In Brandenburg, the development of the system of
privileges was of necessity retarded by the slow progress
made within the electorate by the business of book-publishing
or book-selling. Between the years 1544 and
1575, the present capital of the German Empire contained
not a single printing-press (several attempts made previous
to 1544 to establish a printing business having failed),
and what little printing work it required it was obliged to
have done in Wittenberg or Frankfort on the Oder. In
1567, Johann Eichhorn, of Frankfort on the Oder, received
a privilege to carry on a printing business, which
privilege provided that within the entire Mark no competing
printing-office should be authorised or permitted.</p>

<p>The first book-dealer in Berlin was Hans Werner, who,
in 1594, established his printing-office and shop on the
Cologne side of the Spree. He secured from the Elector
John George, “for the furtherance of public interests,”
a privilege authorising the publication of certain works
(in the main, text-books and books for Church worship)
which had passed the censorship of the Faculty of the
University of Frankfort on the Oder. Any parties
reprinting these books were to be fined two hundred
thalers, half of the fine going to Werner. He also
received an authorisation to establish a bindery, in the
event of the work done for him by the existing bindery
proving unsatisfactory. He was further exempted from
municipal taxes on the condition that he should not overcharge
the citizens of Berlin for his books. It is not
stated by what authority the question of overcharging
was to be determined.</p>

<p>For twenty years, Werner’s establishment remained
the only book concern in Berlin. In 1613, he fell into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>
disfavour with the Elector, John Sigismund (who had
become a convert to Calvinism), by refusing to publish
the writings of the Reformed Church. His privilege was
not withdrawn, but a new privilege was issued to the
Brothers Hans, with whom was associated Samuel Kalle,
for the publication of religious and theological works.
The new firm received, either from the Elector or from
the municipality, a gift of sufficient lumber with which to
build its shop. By the beginning of the eighteenth century,
the number of privileged book-dealers in Berlin had
risen to four, but at that date but one, Michael Rudiger,
was a publisher on his own account. In 1702, The
Orphanage Publishing Concern of Halle (<i>das Hallische
Waisenhaus</i>), a firm still in existence, was authorised to
open a book-shop in Berlin. With the exception of the
productions of this Orphanage Press in Halle, the publications
of Brandenburg-Prussia, during the reign of the
first two kings, were in the main restricted to Bibles,
Hymnals, calendars, and text-books. The privileges in
the new Prussian kingdom, while in form merely authorisations
for the printing of books, covered, in fact, considerably
more than such authorisations. They included
protection against reprinting or piracy, guarantees against
local competition, freedom from taxes and imposts, and
not infrequently assurances of material aid in establishing
a book-business and in carrying it through its first and
most difficult period. The earlier Prussian monarchs
were evidently fully appreciative of the importance to the
higher welfare of the state of this new business of publishing,
and were ready to do whatever might be within the
power of the Government to encourage its development.</p>

<p>With the increase of book-production in Prussia and
in North Germany generally, we find a change in business
methods, and a tendency to separate the work
of publishing from that of printing. With this change
comes a different arrangement of privileges, and a closer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
distinction between authorisations or protections issued
for literary productions and concessions granted for the
purpose of furthering certain trade undertakings. The
former class came to be known as “general” and the
latter as “special” privileges; they were also spoken of
respectively as publishing privileges and printing privileges
(<i>Verlags und Drück Privilegien</i>). Under the latter
classification came calendars and periodicals. Roughly
speaking, the former class of privileges had for their purpose
what we should now term the protection of copyrights,
and the latter the prevention or limitation of
competition. The imperial “general” privileges continued
to be substantially limited in their range to the
imperial cities, at least in so far as they carried with them
monopoly rights.</p>

<p>The Saxon “general” privileges were found to confuse
or interfere with the working of the Leipzig Book-Fair
privileges, and with the beginning of the seventeenth
century they ceased to be issued. The Fair privileges
did not undertake to confer any “monopoly” rights for
a literary undertaking, but simply to secure for a work
the right to be offered to the book-trade of Germany, in
so far at least as this trade now concentrated itself in
Leipzig. The fees for this Book-Fair privilege went into
the treasury of the Fair.</p>

<p>The privileges issued by the Book-Fairs or Book-Trade
Associations of Frankfort and Leipzig are peculiar in the
respect that they make no distinction between publishing
and printing authorisations (<i>Verlags und Drück Privilegien</i>).
Through this lack of recognition of a distinction
which had always heretofore obtained, and also by reason
of the similar form given to the special privileges whose
short terms called from time to time for renewal, not a
little confusion arose in the work of regulating the relations
of the book-trade. It is, in fact, only surprising
that the confusion and the difficulty were not greater,—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
considering that general and special privileges, not only
imperial and Saxon and Prussian, but emanating also from
various of the principalities of the empire, together with
the trade privileges of the Frankfort and Leipzig Associations,
were all more or less in force for any one assortment
of books that could be offered for sale at the two
Fairs. It was not until the eighteenth century that the
confusing and inadequate system of imperial and local
privileges was replaced by interstate copyright conventions
which secured a uniformity of protection for literary
property throughout the States of the German Empire.</p>

<p>The historian Luden says:</p>

<p>“The printing-press is important, not so much on the
ground of its reproduction or multiplication of copies of a
written work, but because of the assurance that these
copies will be distributed. It is hardly to be denied that
in the thought of trafficking in ideas there is something
repelling from which it is difficult to free one’s mind.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>When Luden was writing, the “war of liberation” had
just been brought to a close, and, for the first time since
the battle of Jena, the territory of North Germany was
free from the presence of the invader. It was less than
a decade since the publisher Palm had been shot, under
the instructions of Napoleon, for printing a pamphlet in
defence of the liberty of Germany. The Weimar historian
and the other German writers of his time might
well have been interested in the question of the right of
authors to secure an untrammelled circulation for their
productions. At this time, however, nearly a century
after the death of Palm, a martyr to the cause of the
freedom of the Press, the imperial Government of Germany
is not yet prepared to concede such freedom to its
political critics. The Palm of to-day would indeed not
be shot, but he might be imprisoned and his Press would
certainly be stopped.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span></p>
<p>It was speedily realised that while the production of
books could be developed almost indefinitely, the practicability
of securing a remunerative distribution of books
would be very closely limited unless the inadequacy of
the ordinary trading regulations could be supplemented
by a special system of legislation planned to meet the
special requirements of this new object of trade.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the book-making industry, the
printer was known simply as printer, as it was understood
without further specification that he must also be the
publisher of the works printed by him. Soon, however,
we find associated with his undertakings the names of
partners who had nothing directly to do with the book-manufacturing,
but who contributed their aid either for
the sake of literary development or for some other motives
apart from the thought of business profit, and in
the lists of such associates occur the names of nobles, of
ecclesiastics, and of wealthy scholars. Later, we find
record of printing-houses of larger resources who did not
need and did not accept coöperation from outsiders;
while, as a still later development come the publishing
firms who have separated themselves altogether from the
technical work of book-manufacturing and who employ
only the presses and the binderies of other concerns.
With the beginning of the sixteenth century, begins a
transformation of book-printers into simple book-dealers
or publishers. This change was, of course, however,
far from being universal, but limited itself in the main to
the book-concerns of the two Fair-centres, Frankfort and
Leipzig.</p>

<p>A little later is to be noted an increase in the number
of the publications, the risk and outlay for which were
greater than could safely be assumed by a single publisher,
and in the production of which several publishers
were associated, unless the individual publisher had
secured the necessary aid from some princely friend, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>
occasionally even from a corporation (like the Town
Council of Nuremberg).</p>

<p>Erasmus, writing in the year 1523, concerning the
publishing House of Johann Froben of Basel, speaks of
the three methods under which Froben’s books were
placed in the market. The smaller works, for which the
risk was not too considerable, he would publish as ventures
of his own; while for the more important undertakings,
he would often secure the aid of some outside capitalist,
for whom Froben would act simply as a commission
agent. The third method was to give shares in the venture
to fellow publishers like Lachner, also of Basel,
Koberger of Nuremberg, and Birckmann of Cologne.</p>

<p>Even with such arrangements, however, for the division
of editions between firms having each its own special
channels of distribution, the facilities for placing books in
the hands of buyers, and probably also the actual demand
on the part of any possible buyers, remained very inadequate
in proportion to the means of production and to
the pressure for production. Books which were very
much wanted by a certain number of readers, were not
wanted by enough people to ensure a remunerative sale,
and hence resulted not a few disappointments, losses, and
misfortunes to printers and to publishers. Luther, in his
<i>Table-Talk</i>, makes reference to these troubles of the
printers, but believes the cause of the same to be simply
the commercial greed and lack of intellectual interest on
the part of the public.</p>

<p>The period 1650-1764 witnessed the growth of the system
of book-exchange, under which, publishers in disposing
of their productions were obliged to accept in payment
the stock of other publishers, and the net market value
of books came to be measured in other books. This
method, if it did not add very promptly to the receipts of
the dealers, had at least the advantage of facilitating the
distribution of books, and of furthering the organisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>
of the book-trade. In concentrating into the hands of a
single individual the business of publishing, distributing,
and retailing books, it necessitated the giving of exclusive
attention to the work of handling books.</p>

<p>In the “printers’ period,” the men who interested
themselves in the management of printing ventures were
very apt to interest themselves also in other business
undertakings. Döring, for instance, was in the first place
a goldsmith, and only secondly a printer. Lotter, who
did some of the first printing for Luther, kept a wine-shop
and an inn, in which he not infrequently had Luther as
his guest. Cranach, in addition to being a painter and
an apothecary, carried on a shop for the sale of books and
printing-paper, and finally, in 1524, established a printing-office,
and, associating with himself Döring, entered upon
the production of a complete set of the writings of
Luther.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The necessity of securing for the work of a printing-office
the services of scholarly assistants for the proof-reading
was speedily recognised. Not many printers were
competent to take the responsibility assumed by the
Venetian Aldus, of revising and even of annotating the
texts as printed, and many were the complaints concerning
the grievous errors contained in the earlier volumes
printed in Germany, and the unfavourable comparisons
made between the work of the German compositors and
that which came from the earlier Italian or Paris printers.
Authors contended, with Luther, that the first and
chief right of an author was to have his message correctly
presented to his readers, while scholarly readers were outspoken
in their protests against the marring through the
vagaries and blunders of the typesetters of the beauty
of classical texts or the purport of theologic instruction.
The better printing-houses finally associated with their
work scholarly editors who took charge, not merely of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>proof-reading but of the general supervision of the manuscripts
or texts as these passed through the press; and
the work of a “press-corrector” came to be considered
as professional in its requirements and importance.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>There was, nevertheless, in certain scholarly circles, a
prejudice against the receipt of money for literary work,
or, as Erasmus put it, against being paid by one’s
printer. The objection of Luther to gaining pecuniary
advantage from his writings rested, however, upon the
different ground that his literary work was carried on for
the cause of the Lord and that “Christ had already
rewarded him a thousandfold.”</p>

<p>Erasmus made it a ground for criticism upon Ulrich
von Hutten that the latter had permitted himself to
accept money from his printer.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Brunsel, the defender
of Hutten, denied that he had ever been paid for his
writings, but contended further that if such payment
had been made, it was no reason for reproach. A workman
had a right to be paid for his work. In any case,
said Brunsel, such a criticism came with a bad grace from
Erasmus, who had been under pay with Aldus Manutius
of Venice and with Froben of Basel. From the latter he
was said to have received a yearly honorarium of two
hundred guldens, in payment apparently of editorial
service. There is record of a payment by Aldus, in 1508,
of twenty pieces of gold for some work done by Erasmus
in revising and preparing for the Press the text of the
poems of Plautus.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Thomas Murner received, in 1514,
for his <i>Geuchmatt</i> four guldens,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>—a sum which, as Schurmann
points out, was not so inconsiderable, when we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>remember that the scholar Pellican had been able to support
himself for a year on sixteen guldens.</p>

<p>The jurist, Ulrich Zasius, received, in 1526, from his
publisher in Basel for his <i>Intellectus Juris Singulares</i>, fifty
guldens. Conrad Gesner, writing from Lausanne in 1539,
complains that he has not been able to put as thorough
work into his books as they deserved, because, he says,
“I am, like others of my class, under the necessity of
writing for daily bread.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> A remark of Gesner, in 1558,
that the publishers wanted big books, and were unwilling
to accept small volumes even as a gift, is of interest as
indicating that, even at that early period, the book-trade
of the Continent had behind it an experience by the lessons
of which it could profit.</p>

<p>The relatively large prices paid as compensation for the
literary undertakings referred to in the earlier records, are
evidence that for these undertakings the initiative had
been on the part of the publishers. In the cases in which
the literary suggestion came from the authors, the compensation
was usually materially smaller, or, in case the
venture did not prove remunerative, often disappeared
altogether. The question of the proper rate or extent of
the compensation to authors, was of necessity further
complicated by the growth of the exchange system,
before referred to. When the publisher, out of an edition
of a thousand copies had disposed of five or six hundred,
and had received pay for the same in miscellaneous stock,
a large portion of which might remain in his warehouse
for years, it was certainly not easy to determine what
portion of the edition ought properly to be considered as
having been sold, and to be so accounted for.</p>

<p>The custom soon arose of putting the author’s compensation
into the shape of books. Sometimes he would
receive a certain number of copies of his own work only,
and sometimes, in addition, a selection of the books
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span>against which his own had been exchanged. In the
smaller number of cases only was the author able to
arrange for a portion at least of his pay in money.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The free copies of his book which came to the author
were, however, not infrequently utilised as a means of
securing cash receipts. These were the copies reserved
for the patron who had “graciously accepted” the dedication
of the book. The dedications were too often not
simple expressions of personal friendship or of scholarly
appreciation, but fulsome laudations and exaggerated
flatteries, which were meant to be paid for in hard cash.</p>

<p>Kapp, in decrying this business of selling dedications
or of printing dedications, associates it directly with the
demoralising practice of accepting honorariums from publishers.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
He fails, however, to draw the inference, which
appears to be a natural one, that after two centuries of
publishing (of printed books) the labours of the writers
of the books were so inadequately remunerated that they
were driven to emulate Martial and his associates of the
later Augustan age and to look to patrons (bribed with
dedications) for a payment for their productions.</p>

<p>The real difficulty, as Schurmann points out, lay in the
necessitous and uncertain position of the scholarly classes,
who were driven to put more labour into the writing of
books than the community of the time was prepared to
compensate.</p>

<p>Erasmus treated with indifference the charge of von
Hutten that he made his dedications a subject of trade,
and he probably had sufficient warrant for his indifference.
In the case of not a few of the works of Erasmus,
as with many other books of the time, it seems evident
that in exchange for the dedication, the “patron” of
literature had provided in exchange for the compliment
the funds requisite for the printing of the book, or sometimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span>
even for the support of the author while it was
being written. It occasionally happened (though probably
never with any books of Erasmus) that the “patron”
failed to receive the full consideration for his
services, as there are instances of books in which the
author’s dedication appears only in the author’s “free
copies,” or even only in the portion of the author’s supply
which was to be delivered to the patron. For other
copies of his supply the author might arrange with some
other patron for a dedication, while in the copies left in
the hands of the publisher, still a third dedication might
be used, the earnings of which last had, under the agreement,
been reserved by the publisher.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>According to Kirchhoff<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and Kapp<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> this business of
selling dedications had by the beginning of the seventeenth
century reached very large proportions. The
Magistracy of the city of Leipzig made announcement, in
1594, that they would authorise no more dedications,
having been altogether overburdened with them. In
1606, when the philologist Goldast asked permission of
the Burgomaster of Memmingen to dedicate to him a
new Commentary, he was cautioned that he would have
to content himself with an honorarium of a ducat, as the
magistrates of that place were receiving each day similar
applications.</p>

<p>As late as 1798, the Senate of Hamburg gave notice
that future dedications of literary productions would no
longer receive acknowledgment unless written authorisations
for the same had been previously secured. An
instance occurred in 1887, in which this regulation concerning
a written authorisation was relied upon with some
literalness of interpretation. A musical composition had
been dedicated to the “Shade” of the composer Hummel,
on the fiftieth anniversary of his death. A notice was
issued by the poet Castelli, on behalf of the Hummel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>family, that this dedication must be withdrawn unless a
written authorisation could be shown from the “Shade”
of the departed composer.</p>

<p>According to Kapp, the practice of authors undertaking
the publication of their works at their own risk and expense
(<i>selbst-verlag</i>) developed during the same period as
the dedication system, and together with the latter,
came in great part to a close towards the end of the
eighteenth century. Trade difficulties arose in connection
with the handling by the authors of the editions of
their own books, as it became necessary for them to follow
the general trade practice of the time and to accept
their payment or a portion of their payment in the stock
of the dealers to whom they made sales. Feeling, however,
in no way bound by the regulations of the book-trade,
they were ready to sell this exchange stock at
prices often considerably below those of the regular book-market,
a practice which naturally produced confusion
and dissatisfaction among the dealers. In this practice
the authors of Germany enjoyed a much greater freedom
of action than was possessed at the time by their brethren
in France, where the organised book-dealers had succeeded
in limiting to members of their own body the right
to sell books.</p>

<p>How far the protests of the book-trade may have succeeded
in checking this practice on the part of the
authors of entering into bookselling business without
being willing to submit themselves to bookselling regulations,
it is not easy to determine from the records available.
It is probable, however, that the most effective
check was the disappointing results secured by the authors
themselves from by far the larger portion of their
publishing and bookselling ventures.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century the method
of subscription publishing, which apparently had originated
in England, began to be followed, particularly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>
the case of books issued directly by their authors. Under
this method, subscriptions and advance payments were
secured from subscribers interested in the undertaking
and willing to purchase one or more copies, and the
moneys so advanced were expected to be utilised in the
production of the book, and were as a rule so applied.
Even publishers found this subscription method a convenience
and an advantage in diminishing the risk of the
speculation in an undertaking of importance. In the
case, however, of books issued by publishers on the
subscription plan, it was not usual to receive any money
from the subscribers until the books were delivered.</p>

<p class="center">REGULATIONS FOR THE CONTROL AND THE CENSORSHIP
OF THE PRINTING-PRESS IN FRANCE.</p>

<p class="center">1500-1700.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap"><b>Conflicting Authorities.</b>—The invention of printing
came into the world at a period when men’s minds
were agitated by one of the fiercest contests about
ideas that history had known. This new art gave voice
and wings to thought at the very time when thought
stood for war and when opinions, under the name of
creeds, were bringing men into fierce combat with each
other. Those whose beliefs were wrong (that is to say,
those who at any particular time or place happened to be
the weaker party) were burned by those whose beliefs
were right (that is, by the stronger), and questions of
religion were powerful enough to bring nations into battle
against each other. To permit the peaceable production
and distribution of literature advocating doctrines
sufficiently pernicious to be themselves cause for war,
would have been not only illogical but practically impossible.
It would have constituted, in effect, failure to
keep the faith, and treason to the State.</p>

<p>The general constitution of society was no more compatible
than were the religious passions of the time with
an unrestricted and unsupervised production and distribution
of literature. Monopoly was, or was believed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
be, an industrial necessity. Each branch or division of
industry, trade, or commerce was closely organised and
strictly limited in its range. These guild organisations,
with their accompanying prohibition of the exercise of
individual and unorganised industry, served to maintain
order and to protect artisans against all kinds of exactions,
and in various other ways worked for the benefit of
the artisans and trades as associated. The guilds also
rendered an important service to the community in protecting
the general public against frauds and misdealings,
for, as well from self-interest as from public spirit, they
took upon themselves the supervision of the integrity
and morality of their members. The associated trades
of printing, publishing, and bookselling came under conditions
and restrictions similar in the main to those regulating
the business of the other commercial guilds, and like
these, they undertook to establish a monopoly of the
rights and privileges connected with the manufacture and
sale of their productions.</p>

<p>The contests and quarrels of the “regular” or guild
dealers, whether with authors, who wanted to retain the
right to sell their own books, or with religious communities,
which (in continuation of their old literary practices)
claimed the privilege of using printing-presses of their
own, or with the drapers and fancy goods dealers, who
wanted to sell not only almanacs and primers (<i>abécédaires</i>)
but also general literature, or against the pedlars and
street vendors, who attempted to exercise the full privileges
of booksellers, were endless; but while differing
in many details, these contests were similar in principle
to those carried on by other industrial guilds against outsiders
trying to invade their monopolies.</p>

<p>The official censorship of publications began with the
reign of Francis I., although there are instances in the
previous reign of the issue of certain “permits” or approvals.
These earlier permits were not connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
any conditions or restrictions imposed on the authors
or publishers. They were for the most part secured at
the instance of those interested in the publication,
sometimes as a matter of prudence or from dread of
future interference, but more frequently in order to give
credit or standing to the undertaking.</p>

<p>According to Peignot,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> the earliest printed book which
contains record of such official approval was printed in
Esslingen in 1475. It was a reissue of the <i>Tractatus
Petri Nigri contra perfidos judæos</i>, and bore a certificate
of having been corrected and approved by the Bishop
of Ratisbon. This instance antedates the publication
of the <i>Phœnix</i> of Peter of Ravenna (referred to by Pütter
and others as the first book printed under a privilege),
which was issued in Venice in 1491.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>In 1515, a Bull of Leo X. (previously referred to in the
chapter on Venice) ordered that no licence should be given
for the printing of a book until it had been examined and
approved by an authorised representative of the Church.
The authority of the Church to take into its own hands
the supervision of literature was, as we have seen, from
the outset contested in Venice, and was never accepted
in Germany. In France, on the other hand, the necessity
for such ecclesiastical supervision was at once admitted,
with the condition that the censorship should always be
exercised under the authority and direction of the Crown.
The jurisdiction over printers and publishers, originally
conferred upon the University, continued to be exercised
with more or less effectiveness during two centuries after
the invention of printing, and traces of it existed even
as late as 1789. The University gave approval, issued
privileges, and fixed penalties. An approval had to do
with the contents or character of the work, and was evidence
that it had been examined and had been accepted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>as containing nothing unsound in doctrine, detrimental
to the morals of the community, or dangerous to the
safety of the State.</p>

<p>In the earlier periods of publishing in France, the
ecclesiastical censorship as to matters of doctrine was
exercised through the Theological Faculty of the University.
A privilege gave to its holder a right (usually
exclusive) to control the sales of the work specified and
sometimes of the entire subject to which the work was
devoted, for a given territory and a certain term of
years. In 1498, certain publishers printed a description
of the funeral procession of Charles VIII., in which procession
the Faculty of the University had occupied a
position of honour. The printed account was inaccurate,
<i>Super modo incedendi</i>. The publishers were brought
before the deputies of the University, and after they had
been heard in their defence, their editions of the inaccurate
book were condemned to be burned <i>in processionibus
universitatis</i>.</p>

<p>In 1518, the University issued, by means of placards
posted about the city, an edict prohibiting all publishers,
under pain of forfeiture of their University privileges and
franchise, from printing the <i>Concordat</i> between Francis
I. and Leo X. The King, indignant at such an exercise
of authority on the part of the University, wrote to the
Parliament of Paris demanding that the mandate of the
University be declared null and void, and that the Rector,
Dean, and professors who had issued the same be
punished. He further directed that the <i>Concordat</i> should
at once be delivered to good and trustworthy printers,
with instructions to lose no time in printing supplies of
the same. The Parliament decided that the University
must not concern itself with matters of state or with the
affairs of the King, under penalty of loss of its own privileges,
and the printing and publication of the <i>Concordat</i>
appear to have proceeded in due course. It must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span>
borne in mind that the Parliament of Paris was not a
legislative body, as might be inferred from the later use
of the name, but a high court of justice, exercising the
functions of a Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Several such “Parliaments” were established at different
periods in the great cities of the kingdom, but that
of Paris was the most ancient and important. Its foundation
is ascribed to Louis XI., about 1150. The Paris
Parliament was originally used as a kind of circuit court,
accompanying the King wherever he went. It was, however,
finally fixed at Paris, in 1302, by Philip the Fair.
Its members were at first appointed by the Crown, but
Francis initiated the practice of selling the seats. The
most important function of the Parliament appears to
have been the registration of the laws, edicts, and ordinances
promulgated by the King. The Parliament gradually
assumed a certain degree of political power, and
frequently refused to register laws of which it did not
approve, and from these refusals spirited contests arose
with the Crown. The Parliament of Paris (together with
all the Parliaments of France) was finally suppressed in
1790, by a decree of the constituent assembly. It appears
from the history of this case of the <i>Concordat</i> that
no question was raised concerning the right of the University
to control the printers of Paris, excepting as to
matters belonging to the King; while the higher authority
of the Parliament was not contested.</p>

<p>The first formal institution in France of supervision of
publications or literary censorship dates from the ordinance
of 1521. <i>Lectum est quoddam regis mandatum prohibitorium
ne librarii aut typographii venderent aut ederent
aliquid, nisi auctoritate universitalis et Facultatis Theologiæ,
et Visitatione facta.</i><a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> (Printers and publishers are forbidden
to print or to sell any work which has not first been
examined by the University authorities and received the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>authorisation of the University and of the Faculty of
Theology.) The special authority given to the latter
shows that it was still the risk of heresy and schism
which excited the greatest dread among those supervising
the literature of the community. The edict of
Charles V., also issued in 1521, prescribed similar regulations
for the several countries of his dominions and
made offenders against these regulations liable to the
penalties for treason (<i>lèse-majesté</i>).</p>

<p>Parliament exercised authority not only for the condemnation
of books (a jurisdiction which it had always
claimed, even prior to the invention of printing) but also
to extend general prohibitions, with or without conditions.
As an example, an edict of February, 1525, which
was ordered to be published by heralds at the sound of
the trumpet, directed (among a number of other measures
planned to stamp out the heresies which were spreading
through the realm) all persons having in their possession
copies of the Old or the New Testament, or any portions
of the same, to deliver such books to the court notaries,
and forbade all printers to print and all dealers to sell any
copies of said books under penalty of confiscation of their
goods and banishment from the kingdom. This prohibition
was renewed in 1527. In 1542, Parliament forbade
the printing or selling, without special authorisation, of
the royal ordinances and edicts.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">Parliament, the University, and the Book-Trade.</h3>
<p class="heading">—The
Parliament reserved to itself the final authority in
the supervision of the book-trade, but it occasionally
thought proper to secure, in connection with some literary
undertaking of importance, the counsel of the
University. In 1523, C. Resch, a licensed publisher,
having asked for a permit for the publication of the paraphrases
made by Erasmus of the Gospels of S. Mark and
S. Luke, Parliament referred the application to the Rector,
Dean, and Theological Faculty of the University for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>
examination and report. The report being adverse, the
application was denied. In 1523, Parliament had seized
the books of a bookseller named Louis de Berquin. They
were submitted to the Faculty of Theology and having
been adjudged heretical, were duly burned. In 1529, on
similar grounds, the same fate was awarded to Berquin
himself. In 1521, two decrees were issued by Parliament
forbidding, under penalty of banishment and the payment
of five hundred livres (francs), the printing, either
in French or in Latin, of any work on Christian doctrine,
or on the interpretations of Scripture, that had not first
been approved by the Theological Faculty or its deputies.
A decree of 1535 forbade the printing of any work of
medical science, which had not received the approval of
three “good and notable” doctors of the Faculty of
Medicine of the University. A decree of the same year
forbade the publication of any fortune-telling books or
almanacs, under penalty of imprisonment and a fine of
ten marks. A decree of 1542 forbids the offering for sale
of any book not bearing a certificate showing that it had
been examined and approved by the clerks or deputies of
the Faculty of the University having charge of the subject
to which the book was devoted. In the cities where
there was no university, these examinations, in all classes
of subjects, were entrusted to the vicars or representatives
of the Bishop or to doctors of theology.</p></div>

<p>The tendency became more marked from decade to
decade to place in the control of the Church the supervision
of the entire literary production of the kingdom.
Conflicts of authority arose from time to time between
the University and Parliament, conflicts in which the
advantage usually rested with the latter body, which
claimed the final jurisdiction, and which had behind it
the authority requisite to enforce its decisions.</p>

<p>In 1526, the University had authorised the printing of
certain dissertations against Fabri and Erasmus, written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span>
by Dr. Noel Beda. King Francis wrote to the Parliament
directing it to cause the sale of these books to be
prohibited. He added further general instructions that
Parliament must enforce the previous regulations under
which no books were to be printed or sold, either in Paris
or elsewhere, which had not first been examined and approved
by the members of the court deliberating together.
The prohibition includes even such books as might have
been written by members of the University. The task
of a censorship of this kind, imposed not upon a select,
scholarly committee, but upon a comparatively large body
of consultation, must have been, as the literary production
increased, one of no little difficulty.</p>

<p>It would appear, also, from such record as has reached
us of the complaints of the publishers who had literary
undertakings in train, and of the scholars, instructors,
and students who were waiting for the books, that many
serious and costly delays must have been caused by the
physical impossibility of securing from the Court of Parliament
a prompt decision upon the various literary
schemes submitted.</p>

<p>It appears from the letter of King Francis, first, that
the King had sufficient sympathy with the Reformers to
be unwilling to have Erasmus attacked; and, secondly,
that, even in matters of theological doctrine, the final
decision was entrusted not to the Faculty of Theology,
but to the Court of Parliament. Bayle, writing some
time later, and having a cordial distrust for the Catholic
Faculty of the University of his generation, regretted
that these wise regulations could not have continued
indefinitely.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Chevillier, on the other hand, thinks that
the King’s confidence had been abused, and that his
“<i>grand douceur de caractère</i>” had caused him to be too
gentle to those accused of heresy. Chevillier goes on to
say that the King in the end recognised the justice of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>position taken by the Theological Faculty of the University
in defence of the Church against its enemies. He
got rid of his prepossessions in favour of Erasmus, and,
in 1531, he gave a direct royal authorisation to the publisher
Badius for the printing of Albert Pio’s big treatise
(in twenty-four books) against Erasmus.</p>

<p>In February, 1534, the King sent to the Court of Parliament
letters patent, under which the Court was
instructed to select twenty-four persons qualified and
trustworthy, from among whom the King would select
twelve. To these twelve should be given, until further
instructions, the exclusive privilege of printing books.
Said books were to be printed in the city of Paris and
nowhere else, and were to comprise only those which had
been already approved as required for the public welfare.
No new compositions whatever were to be licensed. The
penalty for infraction of this ordinance was death by
hanging. Legislation of this sort might be considered as
somewhat discouraging to literary production, and as
evidence of increasing dread on the part of the authorities
of the intellectual activities and fermentation which characterised
the period of the Reformation.</p>

<p>The prohibition against the publication of any new
works gives the impression that the activity of literary or
controversial production was on the side of the Reformers,
and that it was thought to be of the first importance
to restrain the publication and distribution of the writings
of the Reformers, even at the inconvenience of hindering
at the same time the publication of sound Catholic
doctrine. What the King wanted to bring about was
evidently the cessation of all religious, or rather of all
theological controversy, and it was, in part at least, due
to his policy in that matter that the mass of controversial
literature produced during the Reformation was so much
smaller in France than in Germany or in Switzerland. It
is to be borne in mind that for the theological literature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
and, in fact, for all the scholarly literature of the sixteenth
century, the political boundaries did not imply, as
they do to-day, barriers of language. The literary language
of Europe was Latin, and the scholars of Europe,
coming, through this common language, into direct relations
with each other, were in a better position to carry
on international controversies than would be the case to-day.
There was nothing but the poverty of buyers or
the prohibitory edicts of the rulers to prevent the general
circulation among all scholarly readers of any work of
importance on the all-absorbing issues of the time. The
letters patent, above referred to, were, says Renouard,
never registered by Parliament, and it does not appear
that they were ever effectively carried into execution.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Beginning of Legislation for the Encouragement
of Literature.</h3><p class="heading">—The restricting edicts continued
through the first half of the sixteenth century, but towards
1550, they began to include provisions referring to the
development and encouragement of good literature.</p></div>

<p>The ordinance of March 7, 1537, provides:</p>

<p>1st. (in reiteration of previous acts) that no work shall
be printed in the kingdom in Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
Arabic, Chaldee, Italian, Spanish, German, French, or
other tongues, which had not first secured the King’s
approval (given through the royal librarian). The list of
languages through which it was supposed that evil might
be instilled into the minds of good Frenchmen, was
certainly sufficiently comprehensive. It is difficult to
imagine any very serious risk of the dissemination of
false doctrine or of the corrupting of the public morals
through the circulation of works in Chaldee.</p>

<p>2d. That a copy of each book when printed be deposited
in the library of the royal château of Blois, being
delivered for the purpose to the King’s trusty councillor
and treasurer, the Abbé Réclus Mellin de Saint-Gelais,
librarian of said château, or to one of the deputies to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
appointed by him for the purpose in each of the universities
and important cities of the kingdom, a certificate
being given as evidence of the delivery of the book.</p>

<p>3d. That a copy of each book printed abroad, and
which it was desired to offer for sale in France, should,
in like manner, be submitted for inspection, and that its
sale in France could be authorised only if said book
should be found worthy of being placed in the Royal
Library, this inspection being necessary for the purpose
of avoiding the risk of introducing into the kingdom
works containing wicked errors such as have heretofore
been found in books imported from abroad.</p>

<p>If copies of these imported works were certified as fit
for sale in France and as worthy of acceptance for the
Royal Library, the librarian was to make payment for
them at the same price as that charged to others. The
ground given for the collection in the Royal Library of
copies of all works issued in France or imported into the
kingdom, was the importance of preserving for future
generations valuable literature which might otherwise
have disappeared altogether from the memory of man,
or which might in later issues have been altered from the
original and accurate text. This edict of 1537 may therefore
be considered as the first step towards the formation
of a library for the preservation of the national literature.
It was also the earliest example in France of the securing
an authorisation for the publication of a book (a concession
that was not yet a copyright and was not always
even a privilege) in consideration of a tax imposed for
the benefit of the nation, said tax comprising a single
copy of the work authorised.</p>

<p>On March 20, 1537, appeared a second ordinance giving
further details of the new measures. The preamble
is worth quoting, because it sets forth clearly the main
purpose which was kept in view in all these earlier regulations
of literary production, namely, the restriction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
the circulation of error and the assuring of the defence of
the holy faith against the assaults of heretics:</p>

<p><i>François, etc. Comme, par tous les moyens que possible
a été, nous avons obvié et empêché que les erreurs et infidèles
interprétations déviant de notre sainte foi et religion chrétienne
ne aient été reçues en notre royaume.</i>... An
ordinance of 1538 appoints Conrad Néobar printer for the
King in Greek, under the following conditions:</p>

<p>1st. Religious works must secure the approval of the
Faculty of Theology, and profane works that of the Faculty
of Belles-Lettres.</p>

<p>2d. A copy of each work printed must be given to
the Royal Library, <i>afin que, si quelque calamité publique
vient à affliger les lettres, la postérité puisse trouver là une
ressource qui permette de réparer en partie une perte des
livres</i>.</p>

<p>3d. That each book issued by Néobar shall contain
the announcement that he is “printer to the King” and
that his Greek printing-office has been instituted under
the royal protection, <i>afin que non seulement ce siècle, mais
aussi la postérité, comprenne avec quel zèle et quelle bienveillance
nous avons traité la litérature, et que la postérité,
avertie pas notre example, croie devoir faire de même, pour
constituer et encourager les études</i>.</p>

<p>In order to guarantee Néobar against the risk of loss,
as the demand for books in Greek was hardly likely to
prove remunerative, the King agreed to pay him per year
the sum of one hundred gold crowns, equal in currency
to about two hundred dollars, but representing, of course,
at that time, a much larger purchasing power. Néobar’s
business was also to be free of taxes, and to enjoy the
other privileges previously accorded to the publishers of
the University. Other printers and publishers were forbidden
to print or to import editions of the works issued
by Néobar, he being granted an exclusive monopoly or
copyright of five years for books which were first published<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span>
by him, whether these were the productions of modern
scholars or were taken from old manuscripts, and of two
years for books which had been reprinted by him in
revised and more complete form from earlier editions.</p>

<p>The fury of civil war and the bitterness of religious
dissension, continued to give a special character to the
laws affecting printing and publishing and to the enforcement
of these. There were also instances in which the
severities of the courts preceded those of the legislators.
In 1545, the records of the <i>Chambre <span class ="err" title="original: syndicat">syndicale</span> de la
librairie</i>, the sub-court charged with the control of publishing,
show that a certain Étienne Polliot was sentenced
for importing and selling heretical books. He
was compelled to carry a bundle of his publications to
the market-place, where he and his books were burned
together. In 1546, the publisher Étienne Dolet, himself
the author of a number of books, published in both Latin
and French, was burned in the Place Maubert, for his
obstinate persistence in the heresy of Calvin. Dolet is
credited with having uttered at the stake the following
line: <i>Non dolet ipse Dolet, sed pia turba dolet.</i> [It is not
Dolet who grieves, but a pious crowd (of witnesses).]</p>

<p>The ordinances of 1557 and 1560 punished with death,
as guilty of treason, the authors, printers, publishers, and
sellers or distributors of books which had been condemned
as pernicious or libellous. The declaration of July 17,
1561, sentenced to the penalty of the lash for the first
offence and to that of death for the second, all printers,
sellers, and distributors of inflammatory or libellous publications.
Letters patent of 1563 fixed the penalty of
hanging or strangling for the offence of printing a book
without the royal authorisation. The often quoted
ordinance of Moulins, of 1566, renews the same prohibitions,
which were further confirmed in 1570, 1571, 1586,
and later. It is not easy to understand why such reiteration
of prohibitions and of penalties was required, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span>
why the provisions of any particular ordinance, or letters
patent, should not have remained in force until repealed,
or at least until the close of the reign.</p>

<p>This ordinance of Moulins, issued by Charles IX.,
brings together under one heading <i>privileges</i> and <i>permits</i>.
It is often referred to as forming the beginning of the
copyright system of France: <i>Défendons aussi à toutes personnes
que ce soit d’imprimer ou faire imprimer aucun
livre ou traité sans notre congé et permission et lettres de
privilège expédiées sous notre grand scel, auquel cas aussi
enjoignons à l’imprimeur d’y mettre et insérer son nom et
le lieu de sa demeurance, ensemble ledit congé et privilège, et
ce sur peine de perdition de biens et punition corporelle.</i></p>

<p>Monsieur Vitet<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> is of opinion that the wars of the
League had some influence in securing a certain freedom
for publishing. The government of the League did not
undertake to free from restrictions the printing-presses of
Paris. It prohibited them, however, only from such
undertakings as seemed likely to prove of service to the
enemies of the League. On the other hand, there was at
Tours a government which was hostile only to such writings
as were not royalist, and at Geneva another government,
the censures of which affected only that literature
which was not Protestant. Through these three limited
censures came into existence three fragments of publishing
freedom. The power of the printing-press in influencing
public opinion may, as far as France is concerned,
be said to date from this period. Without question,
during the previous twenty years, the larger portion of
the publications of a religious, theological, and controversial
character had come from the side of the Protestants.
Their mission was to preach and convince as well
as to fight, and the printing-press was as necessary to
them as were their muskets. The controversial writings
were, however, largely left unanswered, and their authors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>were reduced to the publishing of monologues and,
finally, for a time at least, to the abandonment of the
Press as an active agent in the contest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the Catholics, associated
together in the organisation of the League, had established
themselves as a military power, they undertook
not only to extirpate Protestantism, but to speak to the
world more energetically and more authoritatively than
the Protestants had done. Nothing is more contagious
than speech, especially if such speech take upon itself a
controversial form. As soon, therefore, as the presses
of the League became active, those of the Protestants
renewed their own activities, so that the civil and religious
wars had the double effect of freeing the printing-presses
from a large proportion of their previous
restrictions, and of increasing enormously the amount of
the literary production of these presses. It is to be
noted, however, that production was for the time limited
almost exclusively to works in the department of theology,
while the publication of Greek, Roman, and Italian
classics, no longer encouraged by University supervision
or by royal bounty, was naturally checked. The grand
campaign of the pamphlets was most active during the
years 1588-1589, after which the ardour of the pugnacious
pens appears to have slackened, until, in 1594, the victors
terminated the contest with the final pamphlet of the
series, a Menippean satire, which is said to have been no
less useful to Henry IV. than the battles of Arques and
of Ivry.</p>

<p>The Edict of Nantes, which bears date 1598, contained
a special provision concerning the circulation of publications
favouring the so-called “reformed religion”: <i>Ne
pourront les livres concernant la dite religion, prétendue
réformée, être réimprimés et rendus publiquement qu’ès
villes et lieux où l’exercice public de la dite religion est permis;
et, pour les autres livres qui seront imprimés en autres
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>
villes, seront vus et visités tant par nos ordonnances. Défendons
très expressément l’impression, publication et vente
de tous livres, libelles et écrits diffamatoires, sous les peines
contenues en nos ordonnances, enjoignant à tous nos juges et
officiers d’y tenir la main.</i><a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The essential point of this provision appears to be the
restriction of the sale of Protestant books to certain cities
and districts (the list of which is given elsewhere in the
Edict), in which the public exercise of said religion was
authorised. It is worth noting, however, also, that these
Protestant books are practically classified as libels and
inflammatory writings. The difficulties in the way of
the authors and publishers of such books must have, at
the time, been very considerable. It does not appear
that any provision was made for the circulation of such
publications between the cities in which they were permitted
to be issued, as such circulation must, of course,
have taken them across the “good Catholic” territory,
within the boundaries of which these Protestant books
were incendiary libels. There could in but few cases
have been any possibility of securing within the limits of
any single Protestant city, such, for instance, as Rochelle,
a sufficient sale for a book to render its sale
remunerative, or even to return the outlay required;
while there were no university funds or royal bounties
within the reach of Protestants with which to facilitate
the publication of unprofitable works. There is little
probability, therefore, that for the Protestant works published
in France during this period the authors were able
to secure any compensation whatever, while for the majority
of such books the authors or others interested must
themselves have provided the investment required.</p>

<p>An enactment of 1618 codified the various separate
regulations for the supervision and control (<i>la police et la
discipline</i>) of the business of printing and of publishing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>Among the previous regulations which were repeated in
detail in this enactment were those dating May, 1571,
the substance of which is as follows:</p>

<p>“The master printers now doing business in the city of
Paris, shall choose each year two from among their number
with two of the twenty-four master publishers certified
(<i>jurés</i>) for the same year, the functions of whom shall be
to prevent the printing of any work of a libellous or
incendiary or heretical character; and to insure the correctness
and satisfactory quality of the editions which
may be printed in each city of the realm.” This last
responsibility was understood to cover not only an approval
of the quality of the paper and the presswork, but
also a careful supervision of the correctness of the type-setting
and of the quality of the type, which must not be
worn (<i>trop usée</i>), and if these supervisors find errors calling
for reprimand, they are to make report of the same
before either a civil or a criminal judge according to the
nature of the fault.</p>

<p>The said publishers are limited in the prices they are
permitted to charge for their publications, the price per
sheet for works in Latin (not including notes in Greek)
not to exceed ten deniers, for works in Greek not to
exceed six deniers. There is a further clause providing
for a proportionate reduction in the schedule of prices
specified, whenever in the judgment of the Rector, deans,
masters, and twenty-four certified publishers of the University,
a lessening of the cost of production or of handling
may justify such reduction.</p>

<p>In 1587, an order in council confirmed the exemption
of the book-business from all subsidies and from customs
duties and municipal tolls and taxes. In 1617, the Syndic
and directors of the Guild of publishers, printers, and
binders submitted a request to the Provost of Paris to be
authorised to select for a special commission to take into
consideration the condition of the book-business, six certified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
publishers, six non-certified publishers (practically
book-dealers), and six printers. To this commission
were joined the Syndic of the Guild and four of its board
of directors, and under its recommendations and as a
result of investigations extending into the following year,
were drafted the regulations embodied in the letters
patent of 1618.</p>

<p>The preamble says:</p>

<p><i>Et d’autant que, parmi le bruit et l’insolence des armes,
ceux qui font profession des bonnes lettres ont été les plus
oppressés et comme réduits à néant, nous avons, en ensuivant
les anciens vestiges de nos prédécesseurs, apporté tout le soin
à nous possible de les rétablir en leur première splendeur,
principalement en ce qui regarde notre fille âinée, l’université
de notre bonne ville de Paris</i>, etc.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that the profession of letters is made
practically synonymous with the University of Paris.
The statutes contain thirty-eight articles. The first confirms
the franchises and immunities of the Guild of publishers,
printers, and binders.</p>

<p>Articles 2, 5, and 11 give consideration to the subjects
of apprenticeship, the admission of associates and of masters,
the obligation (for each master) of keeping not less
than two presses in running order, the rights of widows,
etc.</p>

<p>The twelfth article prescribes that all printers and publishers
must print their books in handsome, legible type,
carefully corrected, and on good paper, and that each
volume must bear at its beginning or end the name and
trade-mark of its publisher, and the record of the privilege
and permit under which it is issued; and in case the
book has been printed without permit, the entire edition
is to be confiscated, in addition to further penalties.</p>

<p>Article 13 provides that printers or publishers who issue
books of a libellous or defamatory character, shall be
deprived of their privileges and immunities, and shall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span>
thereafter, be enjoined from exercising the trade of printing
or book-selling.</p>

<p>This article, however, was not intended to trench
upon the sphere of penal legislation. In this same year,
1618, a poet named Durand, convicted of having written
a libel against Louis XIII., was condemned to be broken
on the wheel and afterwards burned. Two brothers,
Italians, were executed with him, for having translated
the book into Italian.</p>

<p>Article 15 specifies that two copies of each book published
were to be deposited in the Royal Library (an
increase of one copy over the requirements of the enactment
of 1571), one copy was to be given to the Syndic,
apparently for use in the Guild library, and four copies
could be retained for the printers and their associates.</p>

<p>Article 16 provides that for the future not more than
one publisher, one printer, and one binder should be
admitted each year to the Guild, the purpose being to
reduce the membership of this.</p>

<p>Article 17 provides for the election each year of the
Syndic and of two of the deputies.</p>

<p>Article 18 gives consideration to the examination of
books by the syndics, to the restrictions to be placed
upon the trade in France of foreign book-dealers, to colporteurs,
book-sales, etc.</p>

<p>Article 19 provides for the seizure of unauthorised
foreign reprints of French books.</p>

<p>Article 30 forbids any single individual or firm from
having more than one shop or printing-office, which must
(doubtless for the greater convenience of official supervision)
be within the precincts of the University.</p>

<p>Article 31 forbids the sale of books in book-stalls and
book-carts.</p>

<p>These last two prohibitions were considered of sufficient
importance to be repeated in a separate act issued in
1630. They were directed more particularly against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span>
practice which was increasing among certain persons of
quality of keeping printing-presses in their houses.</p>

<p>Article 32 forbids, under penalty of confiscation of
goods and 3000 francs fine, the printing outside of the
kingdom of any work to be issued with a French imprint,
or the disguising or concealing of either the publishing
imprint or the record of the place of manufacture.</p>

<p>Article 38 provides that each publisher, printer, and
binder must be sworn before the Provost of Paris, or his
deputy, in the presence of the <i>procureur</i> of the King.</p>

<p>The noteworthy changes brought about by the enactment
were: the reduction in the number of authorised
publishers and printers, a reduction to be brought about
by the limitation of the new members to one of each
class per year, the transfer to the Provost of Paris of a
function heretofore exercised by the University, and the
restriction of the printing-presses in such a manner as to
facilitate the police supervision of the authorities.</p>

<div class="just"><h3 class="text">The Relations of the Crown to Literary Production
and the Attempt of the Church to Secure a Portion of
the Control.</h3><p class="heading">—The tendency of all the enactments during
the previous thirty years had been, as we have seen, to
concentrate in the hands of the Crown, acting directly
through its own subordinates, the control of literary
production.</p></div>

<p>From time to time, however, the Court of Parliament
reasserted its claim to the exercise of a joint control with
the King, and the declaration of 1612 appears to have
been issued in order to put an end to any such claims.</p>

<p><i>Défendant très expressément a nos âmes et nos feaux
conseillers, maîtres des requêtes, et gardes des sceaux de nos
chancelleries, et de nos cours de parlement, donner aucune permission
d’imprimer livres ou écrits, sur mêmes peines que
dessus contre les imprimeurs ou librairies qui auraient
obtenu telles permissions.</i></p>

<p>Authorisation to publish was from this time on dependent
on the securing of permits sealed with the royal seal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span></p>

<p>In 1624, four royal censors were instituted by letters
patent. Two of them were to have each six hundred
livres a year, and the others, four hundred livres.
The first four censors, André Duval, Pierre Quedarne,
Jacques Messier, and François de Saint Père, were all
doctors of the Theological Faculty of Paris. The privilege
of filling such vacancies as might occur in the board
was in the first place given to the College of the Sorbonne.
Notwithstanding this selection of the board from the
members of its own Faculty, the University, or at least
the theological division of the University, was seriously
dissatisfied with losing its ancient privileges of controlling
directly the examination of religious literature. In 1629,
fresh regulations were issued by the Crown in connection
with the censorship, under which, works submitted for
publication, instead of being examined by a board appointed
in advance, were passed upon by censors particularly
designated for each work by the Chancellor or the
Privy Seal. In 1658, the Chancellor Séguier had designated
three readers or examiners who again appear to
have constituted a permanent board.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the edict of 1629, the Theological
Faculty of the University continued to claim the right to
pass upon all publications of a religious character. This
right was also recognised in ordinances of a later date,
and the examinations of the Faculty were held concurrently
with those of the royal censors or of the deputies
designated by these. Under the ordinance of 1629, the
publisher or author seeking a permit to print was obliged
to submit for examination two complete copies of his
manuscript, a requirement which could be modified only
under the authority of the Chancellor or Privy Seal.</p>

<p>The general result of the ordinance of 1629 was not
in the direction of freedom for the printing-press, but
there were certain advantages secured by the writers and
makers of books in having consolidated into one code restrictions
and regulations which had heretofore existed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span>
isolated letters, ordinances, and edicts. The creation of
royal censors, an act harmonising with the centralising
tendencies of the times, may be understood also as a
recognition on the part of the Crown of the increasing
influence of literature, and of the importance of bringing
literature into direct dependence upon the authority of
the monarch.</p>

<p>The founding, in 1635, of the French Academy, had
an important influence as well upon the organisation of
authors as upon the relations of these with the Crown.
It was the general scheme of Richelieu, continued
later by Louis XIV., in the first place to put literature
exclusively under the authority of the Crown, and
secondly, through privileges and favours, to secure its
support for the interests of royalty. It is evident that
the King, or at least the King of this date, neither created
nor extended the supervision of literature, for the
idea had as yet occurred to none that the printing-press
could be left free. There was also, probably, no deliberate
purpose to bribe or corrupt the authors of the time.
It was, however, no new idea for men of letters to be
dependent upon the favour of princes, and there was, it
is fair to remember, a certain direct advantage for literature
as well as for the Crown in adding to the social position
and general welfare of writers. While the edict
establishing the Academy bore the date of 1635, its incorporation
was completed only by the <i>lettres de cachet</i>, of
July 10, 1637. In these letters appears the following
curious restriction:</p>

<p>“Provided, namely, that the members of said Assembly
and Academy shall concern themselves only with the
history, embellishment, and development of the French
language,” a restriction which was evidently acted upon,
later, with considerable breadth of interpretation.</p>

<p>In 1686, a further enactment for the supervision of
publishing and printing was recorded in the Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span>
of Paris. In this were repeated the several provisions in
the enactment of 1629, with the following modifications:
Three complete copies, instead of two, of each book
printed, should be deposited, and no additional printer
should be admitted into the Guild until the number of
master-printers had been reduced to thirty-six. There
was also a provision forbidding publishers from carrying
on a printing business under their licence as publishers.
The board of control of the Guild is given special authority
for the examination of works imported from abroad,
with the purpose of preventing the circulation in France of
<i>Livres ou Libelles diffamatoires contre l’honneur de Dieu, le
bien et répos de notre état, ou imprimés sans nom d’auteur,
ou du libraire, ou des livres contrefaits sur ceux qui auront
été imprimés avec privilége</i>, etc.</p>

<p>In the same year appeared an enactment, under which
the bookbinders and gilders were separated from the
Guild of publishers and printers. As in 1618 and in 1649,
the University found ground for complaint that these
regulations had been framed without its participation.
It secured the appointment of a commission of State
councillors to examine into its complaint, but the report
of the commission was adverse to the contention of the
University. Of its old responsibilities and privileges for
the supervision and control of literary undertakings, there
rested now with the University only certain inconsiderable
forms, and the restriction upon printers and publishers
to carry on their business in the University quarter.</p>

<p>The issue of permits and the charges to be paid for the
same, were regulated by letters patent of 1701, the provisions
for pamphlets being made different from those for
books. The authorisation for the printing and publishing
of books was, as heretofore, to be granted under the
great seal. The authorisation for the printing of pamphlets
was to be given by the local magistrates, and after
an examination of the material by inspectors appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span>
by the magistrates for the purpose. A pamphlet was
defined to be a work containing not more than two
sheets. When the permit given under the great seal
included a general privilege securing for the publisher the
exclusive control for the kingdom of the work issued, the
sum paid for the same was to be determined by the general
tariff of the great seal.</p>

<p>When the permit gives control over a limited district
only, the charge is made but one third of that for a
general privilege. If the authorisation includes no privilege,
either general or limited, the sum paid for the same
shall be five livres.</p>

<p>When the works are published in series, the different
parts of which are issued at different times, each part
must be examined and authorised for itself; and each
examination must in any case include the prefaces, dedications,
and supplements.</p>

<p>The “general privileges” associated with permits,
referred to in these letters, are not to be confounded with
another class of general privileges which were from time
to time conceded directly by the Crown either to individuals
or to associations or companies as well for works
already composed as for those still to be written. This
latter class of royal privilege was abolished, and those in
force at the time were revoked, by orders in council of
1659 and 1686. An exception, however, was made as
late as 1714, in the case of certain general privileges
accorded by the Crown to the Academy of Letters, and
to the Academy of Painting and Sculpture.</p>

<p>A contest arose, in 1702, between the Chancellor de
Pontchartrain and the higher clergy on the question of
certain general privileges which the bishops claimed to
be still in force. The bishops, possessing already an unquestioned
right to print, without special permits, their
episcopal charges and letters, and also the catechisms used
for the instruction of the young people of the diocese,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span>
thought they could take advantage of the ardour of the
King against Jansenism and Quietism, gradually to extend
their privileges so as to make these include all works of a
devotional character.</p>

<p>The Chancellor refused to give consideration to any
such claims and the resulting disputes continued over
some years. The bishops contended that, being themselves
the final judges of the doctrines of the Church,
utterances made by them, or utterances or writings accepted
by them, could not with propriety be passed upon
by others who were not authorities upon points of doctrine.</p>

<p>The Chancellor simply maintained the binding force of
the old regulations, and took the ground that, while the
Government would always require the counsel of the
bishops on literature involving points of doctrine, the
final decision as to the advisability of the publication of
any particular work must, as heretofore, rest with the
Crown. He undertook further to take all necessary measures
to prevent the publication of any works which might
appear to be inimical to the liberties of the Church of
France.</p>

<p>Madame de Maintenon gave the weight of her influence
in favour of the bishops, the question having come
up in tangible shape in connection with certain works
that the Bishops of Meaux and of Chartres had written in
controversy with a certain prolific writer named Simon,
and which were now in readiness for the press.</p>

<p>The King dreaded exciting the ire of the Jesuits and
dreaded also, says the chronicle, the risk of putting
Madame de Maintenon into a bad temper. He avoided,
therefore, making a decision, and contented himself with
expressing the wish that the parties would arrange some
adjustment of the difficulty. An adjustment was finally
arrived at, under which the bishops withdrew their pretensions
concerning the general oversight of doctrinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span>
literature, but reaffirmed their right (which had never
been disputed) to have their counsel taken before permits
were issued for any works of this class. The privilege
was accorded to them (this concession being practically
the sole result of the issue) of printing and publishing,
without official permit, works written by themselves.
The control of documents concerning ritual and of catechisms
was also left in their hands.</p>

<p>Disputes subsequently arose concerning the interpretation
of the authority for the publication of works written
by the bishops. They themselves and their Jesuit allies,
with the powerful aid of Madame de Maintenon, contended
that this authorisation covered all doctrinal literature.
The Chancellor, on the other hand, maintained
that it was limited to missals, rituals, books of the liturgy,
and other official volumes connected with the service of
the Church. A formal decision does not appear to have
been arrived at, but in the subsequent practice the view
of the Chancellor was in the main adhered to.</p>

<p>Bossuet wrote to the King, to Cardinal de Noailles,
and to Madame de Maintenon several indignant protests
concerning the attempt of the Chancellor to control the
utterances of the Church. It is not to be thought of,
says Bossuet, that the Holy Church of Christ shall be
compelled to submit, for the examination of magistrates,
its decrees, catechisms, and spiritual teachings upon matters
which would be confined strictly to the instructors of
their flock. The Church must be left free to print, sell,
and distribute its prayers and its instructions to its children
and its ministers. The responsibility that has been
placed in the hands of the rulers of the Church for the
preservation of the faith and for the instruction of the
people in this faith, comes to them from Christ himself,
and any attempt to take away or diminish this responsibility
is an attack upon the faith and an intention to
humiliate the Church.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The King, influenced by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span>pleading of Bossuet, finally brought himself to a decision,
which, while not covering all the questions involved, gave
to the bishops whose works were at the moment under
consideration the satisfaction claimed. To the Bishop of
Chartres was accorded, in 1703, a general privilege for
the term of ten years covering all breviaries, missals,
diurnals, antiphonals, graduals, processionals, episcopal
letters, psalters, hours, catechisms, ordinances, statutes,
and pastoral instructions which were required under the
general usage of the diocese.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center">THE BEGINNINGS OF LITERARY PROPERTY IN ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="center">1474-1709.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">IN the preceding studies of the varying relations to the
Government and to the community of literary productions
and of the gradual development under the
extension of the system of local privileges of the policy
of protecting and encouraging literary production, but
little reference has been made to the publishing methods
and the conditions of literary production in England. It
was in fact the case that during the first two centuries
after printing, the conditions in England had very little
influence upon the development of any European system
for controlling or protecting literary production. The
work of the earlier English printers was, as we have seen,
addressed much more to the tastes of the local public
than to the requirements of the scholars of Europe, and
while a certain proportion of books were, in England as
on the Continent, printed in Latin, this proportion was
much smaller than with the undertakings of the contemporary
publishers of Holland, Germany, and France.</p>

<p>While increasingly large importations were made from
year to year, more particularly from Paris, Amsterdam,
Basel, and Cologne, of books needed for use in Oxford,
Cambridge, and London, the export during these two
centuries for Continental sale, of books printed in England,
was but inconsiderable. In the matter of legislative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[465]</span>
enactments, or of the policy of the State towards
literary production, we have seen Paris following to some
extent the precedents set in Venice. Upon this same
general system of privileges for short terms and for limited
territory, privileges gradually extended to longer
terms and to cover additional States. The earlier practice
in Germany had on the whole also been based upon
the Italian precedents. Holland was the first of the
European States to issue privileges without conditions
depending upon censorship, but apart from this very
essential distinction, the Dutch privileges were, in form,
very similar to those of Venice and Milan. In no one of
these countries does any particular attention appear to
have been given to the methods and practices of England,
and the English system for the regulation of literary
property, a system which grew up in connection with the
practical monopoly given to the Stationers’ Company,
appears to have taken shape (English fashion) with very
little, if any, reference to Continental precedents. The
Stationers’ Company received its charter, by royal decree,
in 1556 (two years after the marriage of Queen Mary to
Philip of Spain). It constituted an organisation of the
printing and publishing trade of London which assumed
to represent the publishing interests of the country.
The Company differed from the book-trade association
of Paris in that it had no direct connection with either of
the two Universities, and held its authority directly from
the Crown. The <i>libraires jurés</i> of Paris were, it is to be
remembered, members of the University, and the regulations
governing their operations formed part of the law
of the University. The members of the British Company,
on the other hand, were manufacturers and traders
who had received directly from the Crown a monopoly of
the business of printing books, and the regulations formed
for them and by them required only the approval of the
royal authorities or representatives of the Crown, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span>
when this had been given, these regulations became the
law for the control of the book-trade, and for the control
also of the literary property (the property in “copy”)
that was, from year to year, coming into existence and increasing
in importance. The basis of the authority of the
Stationers’ Company was the theory that all printing was
the prerogative of the King. While this theory was
never pushed to its logical conclusion, it secured a certain
foundation in the direct ownership and monopoly asserted
and enforced by the Crown in the printing of certain
classes of literature which formed the most considerable
and remunerative of the earlier productions of the English
Press, such as prayer-books and other works of service
of the State Church, of which Church the King was
the head, the editions of the Bible, the cost of translating
which had been borne by the Crown, almanacs (on the
ground that they were abstracted from the prayer-book),
year-books, Acts of State, etc. The assigns of the royal
copyright in almanacs were not always, however, able to
support their claim to an exclusive control. Scrutton
cites one case (among several) in which this claim was
overruled.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>The printers did not attempt any opposition (which
would in any case have been futile) to these contentions
of the Crown. They purchased patents or privileges for
the production of the King’s books or publications owned
by the Crown, and they found it to their advantage, at a
time when the Crown was all-powerful, to strengthen
their position with the community at large by securing
the royal sanction and a royal grant for the undertakings
to the originating of which the Crown could make no
claim. Such property-right as could be said to exist in
these last was also derived from the royal grant. The
distinctive feature in the development of literary property
in England may be said to be the all-important part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span>claimed and exercised by the Crown in its creation and
protection. I do not find in any other State of Europe a
parallel to the relation of the Crown to the beginnings of
copyright. Even in France, where the supervision of the
Press passed eventually into the direct control of the
King, the royal edicts and privileges give the impression
rather of defining and of limiting than of creating property
in the “copy.” I do not overlook the contentions
that came to be argued out at a later date concerning the
existence of copyright as a property at Common Law, an
existence apart from and independent of a royal edict or
of a legislative statute. I am merely pointing out the
actual form given to these preliminary undertakings of
the English printer-publishers, under which form they
secured directly from royal authority the right to hold
and to defend their “copy.”</p>

<p>I will recall for the purposes of this summary, that the
first privilege in England bears date 1518, and was issued
to Richard Pynson, King’s Printer, the successor, second
in line, to Caxton. In 1504, we find the first record of
the office of “Printer to the King,” when William
Faques placed on the title-pages of his books the term
<i>Regius Impressor</i>. The office apparently continued in
existence, with rather varying functions, until the revolution
of 1688. The successor of Faques was Richard Pynson,
and he was the first English printer to use the term
<i>cum privilegio</i>, which appears on the title-page of one of
his books in 1518. The full wording of this privilege is
worth quoting:</p>

<p><i>Cum privilegio impressa a rege indulto, ne quis hanc
orationem intra biennium in regno Angliæ imprimat aut
alibi impressam et importatam in eodem regno Angliæ vendat.</i>
This privilege gives a monopoly, for the term of
two years, for a certain <i>Orationem</i>. The date is fifteen
years later than that of the first privilege issued in France.
The shortness of the term is to be noted, the majority of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span>
French and Italian privileges of this period being for from
five to ten years. Pynson prints on his title-pages simply
<i>cum privilegio a rege indulto</i>, without any reference
to limit of term. In 1530, a privilege of seven years is
granted to an author in consideration of the value of his
work, and this appears to be the first record of an English
copyright being granted to an author.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The first dispute about English copyright of which we
have record, arose about 1530, when a printer named
Trevers reprinted, without authorisation, a work the
privilege for which had been issued to Wynkyn de Worde.
The preface to Worde’s second edition, issued in 1533,
contains a vigorous complaint at this piratical interference
with his rights, but does not inform us what steps,
if any, had been taken to defend these rights. Scrutton
does not mention the name of the book, but it was
probably <i>The Mirroure of God for the Sinfull Soule</i>.</p>

<p>Royal privileges continued to be issued during the
sixteenth century, while after 1556, the entries in the registers
of the Stationers’ Company are made evidence of
the exclusive rights to the persons named for printing the
book specified. Finally the privileges issued by the King
came to an end, being superseded by the registers of the
Company. The King’s privileges had been for specific,
and usually for quite brief, terms. The entries of
“copies” on the Stationers’ registers made no specification
of terms, and such property rights as were indicated
or initiated by these entries were, therefore, for an indefinite
term and could be claimed to be in perpetuity.
These Stationers’ Hall entries were in certain respects
similar to the records in the Land Office of a western
Territory or in the County Clerk’s office of a State,
records which serve as final evidence of the title or
ownership of the lands specified. The copyright registers
served as do the land records, for the transfers of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span>ownership as well as for the original certificate of ownership,
and with the “copies” as with the parcels of land,
the ownership was understood to be based on the Common
Law, and to be in perpetuity. The King’s patents
or grants for the “copies,” the ownership of which, as
previously specified, was claimed by the Crown, continued
to be given for specified terms, to certain favoured
individuals selected as “Printers to the King.” Apart
from these books, the specification of a limited term for
the control of any particular book ceases with the close
of the royal privileges.</p>

<p>As before stated, the Stationers’ Company, in giving
title to property in a “copy” or literary production, acted
as the representative of the authority of the Crown, an
authority which had, it was claimed, been bestowed upon
it by the royal charter. Under this royal authority, the
Stationers’ Company possessed for a long series of years
the monopoly of printing throughout the United Kingdom.
Printing could be done only by the members of
the Company, and the by-laws adopted by the Company
for the regulation of printing, in so far as they did not conflict
with the statutes of the kingdom, became part of the
law of the land.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> The purpose of the earlier English
ordinances concerning printing, and of the ordinances
establishing the Stationers’ Company itself, was specified
in substance as follows: “The order and regulation of
printing and of printing-presses in the interests of Church
and State.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The operations of an association of printers,
an association which owed to the Crown its existence,
its authority, and the property rights in its valuable
monopoly, could be supervised and controlled to an
extent that would not have been practicable with the
undertakings of printers acting independently. With
reference to the maintenance of the royal authority, it
was certainly wise policy for the Crown thus to secure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span>and to maintain an effective control over the work of the
printing-press, this new instrument for influencing public
opinion. The later effect of this royal absolutism was,
curiously enough, to secure an earlier and more definite
recognition in England than was reached in any other
country, for property in literary production, and for the
right of literary producers to control and to enjoy the
results of their labours. The fact that there was a property,
without limit or term, in the “copy” of a literary
production, that is, in its copyright, was understood to
have been established by the evidence of the Stationers’
registers, and by the assured practice, extending over a
series of years, of authors, printers, and publishers. The
control of the work of the Stationers was, in 1637, placed
in the hands of the Star Chamber, and the decree issued
in that year by the Chamber had for its immediate purpose
the regulation and restraining of the printing of “libellous,
seditious, and mutinous books.” As an essential
detail of this regulation, it was again ordered that “every
book should be licensed and entered into the Register’s
book of the Company of Stationers.” The replacing, in
1640, of the absolutism of the Star Chamber by the absolutism
of the Long Parliament (an absolutism no less arbitrary,
though based upon a very different source of authority)
made no change in the completeness of the authority left
with the Stationers’ Company. The Parliamentary Ordinances
of 1641, in prohibiting printing or importing without
the consent of the owner of the copies of said books,
constituted a clear statutory recognition of property in
“copy,” a recognition evidently resting, says Scrutton,
upon an understanding of its existence under the Common
Law.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The Act of 1643 for “redressing disorders
in printing,” and the licensing Act of 1662, while also
having for their main purpose the control of literature of
political influence, continued to affirm or to imply the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span>existence of property in the “copy” of books. A reference
in the latter Act indicates that the owners of
“copies” were at this time not necessarily members of
the Stationers’ Company. The inference is that an
author, in arranging to print his book through a licensed
stationer, did not always dispose of his copyright. The
licensing Act gave a statutory protection for copyright, a
protection the provisions of which were of necessity limited
to the term of the Act itself and of its several renewals,
the last of which expired in 1694. While the recovery
of statutory penalties was thus limited, the expressions
used in the Act, as was the case with the preceding Acts,
made continued recognition, by expression or by implication,
of the existence of copyright property independent
of the statute, the protection of which could be
maintained under the Common Law. The English authorities
on the subject, Maugham, Coppinger, Scrutton,
and others, and the American Drone, are at one in the
opinion that, at the period in question, the close of the
seventeenth century, it was the general understanding
that authors possessed in their productions a perpetual
right of property, and that this right could be assigned.
Such an understanding, an understanding upon which
were based Parliamentary Acts for regulation and for
licence, and in accord with which were carried on important
and continued business undertakings, marked a development
in the conception of literary property which had
as yet been reached in no other country. Scrutton admits
that the records of the courts do not supply the
evidence that might be looked for in support of this contention.
There are, namely, no entries of prosecutions
in the advisory courts for printing without a licence.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
He points out, however, that the Stationers’ Company
had under its charter summary rights of search, seizure,
and imprisonment, and that similar powers were confirmed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[472]</span>or renewed by the Licensing Acts. In case of infringement,
therefore, no recourse to the ordinary courts
was needed, and no records of proceedings would exist.</p>

<p>The Act of April, 1710,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> known as the Act of Queen
Anne, under which a statutory protection for a term of
fourteen years was given to the author of a literary production,
had the result of bringing to a close for Great
Britain the period of Common Law copyright. This
result was probably not intended by the legislators who
framed the Act, and was certainly not anticipated by the
publishers at whose instance the matter had been taken
up, and who were simply applying for a more specific and
more effective protection (during such term as Parliament
saw fit to grant) for the property in their “copies,” of
the existence of which property there had as yet been no
question. It was, in fact, not until 1769 that any serious
contention was raised against the continued validity of
copyright at Common Law. In that year the Common
Law right was maintained in the decision rendered in the
famous case of Millar <i>vs.</i> Taylor, a decision rendered the
more noteworthy because it was concurred in by Lord
Mansfield, the greatest authority on the subject of copyright
whom Europe had thus far known.</p>

<p>In 1774, in the case of Donaldson <i>vs.</i> Becket, the issue
was raised for the second time, the property involved
being the same in each suit, the “copyright” of Thomson’s
<i>Seasons</i>. In this case, the House of Lords reversed
its previous decision. Its conclusion was in substance:
first, that an author had a Common Law right to his production
before publication (ten judges in the affirmative
and one dissenting); second, that after the publication
such Common Law right still rested in the author (eight
judges in the affirmative and three in the negative); third,
that under the statute of 1710, the author had lost his
right of action at Common Law and retained protection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span>for his copyright only during the term prescribed by the
statute (six judges in the affirmative and five in the negative);
fourth, that the right at Common Law possessed
by the author and his assigns prior to 1710 had been a
right in perpetuity (seven judges in the affirmative, four
in the negative). In each of these votes, including that
on the vital issue of the effect upon the Common Law
right of the statute of 1710, Lord Mansfield was recorded
in favour of the continued right of the author at Common
Law, and of the perpetuity of copyright, irrespective of
the effect of this statute.</p>

<p>The result of this decision in Donaldson <i>vs.</i> Becket was,
as said, to bring to a close what may be called the Common
Law period of copyright in England, and to replace
this by a copyright protection limited to terms of the
successive statutes. This whole matter is in its date
beyond the period considered in the present narrative.
For this reason, notwithstanding the continued pertinence
and importance of the issues raised in these two
noteworthy suits and the distinctive interest of the arguments
presented by the famous advocates on either side
of the question, it has not seemed to me in order to
undertake to give here any detailed analysis either of the
arguments or of the two decisions arrived at. It is
proper, however, to make this brief reference to the
results of these two cases as well because the Act of 1710
marked, as explained, a definite epoch in the history of
literary property in England, as because this Act, the
discussions which gave rise to it, and the much more important
discussions which resulted from it sixty years
later, marked a development in England of a conception
of literary property and of an education of public opinion
concerning it which had not as yet been reached in any
State in Europe. We find in France no such discussions
and no legislation based upon a recognition of the principles
underlying literary property, until the Convention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[474]</span>
of 1793. It required a revolution to bring about in
France a result that in England was arrived at in regular
course in the ordinary development of law.</p>

<p>This brief reference to the development in England of
the recognition of the rights of literary producers may
be fitly concluded with a quotation from the eloquent
plea of John Milton in behalf of the liberty of the printing-press.</p>

<p>In 1644, an order for the regulation of printing was
under consideration in Parliament (the Long Parliament)
which provided that “No Book, Pamphlet, or Paper,
shall be henceforth printed unless the same be first
approved and licensed by such as shall be thereto appointed.”
Milton had been a persistent opponent of
the policy of censorship and licensing, and in defiance of
the ordinance of 1643 (an ordinance in which the decrees
of the Star Chamber abolished in 1640 had been in substance
renewed) he had published in that year, without
licence and without printer’s name, his treatise on
<i>Divorce</i>. The Stationers’ Company, recognising the
danger to their authority of a defiance by an author like
Milton, had the matter brought up in the Commons. It
was referred to the committee on printing and the order
above cited was the result. The famous <i>Areopagitica</i>, an
oration in the form of a pamphlet, was then written by
Milton to protest against the whole theory of the exercise
by Government licensers of a supervision and control
of literature, or of the delegation of such control to a
commercial company which was the creation of Government.
The author of <i>Paradise Lost</i> speaks as follows:</p>

<p>“For that part which preserves justly every man’s
copy to himselfe, or provides for the Poor, I touch not,
only wish they be not made pretenses to abuse and persecute
honest and painfull men, who offend not in either of
these particulars. But that other clause of Licensing
Books, which we thought had dy’d with his brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span>
Quadragesimal and Matrimonial when the Prelats expir’d,
I shall now attend with such a Homily as shall lay
before ye, first, the inventors of it to bee those whom ye
will be loath to own; next, what is to be thought in generall
of reading, whatever sort the Books be, and that
this Order avails nothing to the suppressing of scandalous,
seditious, and libellous Books, which were mainly
intended to be suppresst; last, that it will be primely to
the discouragement of all Learning and the stop of Truth,
not only by disexercising and blunting our abilities in
what we know already, but by hindering and cropping
the discovery that might bee yet further made both in
religious and civill Wisdome.</p>

<p>I deny not, but that it is of greatest concernment in
the Church and Commonwealth, to have a vigilant eye
how Bookes demeane themselves as well as Men; and
thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharper justice on
them as Malefactors. For Books are not absolutely dead
things, but doe contain a potencie of Life in them to be
as active as that Soule with whose progeny they are;
nay, they do preserve as in a violl the purest afficacie and
extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I
know they are as lively, and as vigorously productive, as
those fabulous Dragons’ teeth, and being sown up and
down, may chance to spring up armed men. And yet,
on the other hand, unlesse wariness be us’d, as good
almost kill a Man as kill a good Book; who kills a Man
kills a reasonable creature, God’s Image; but hee who
destroys a goode Booke, kills Reason itselfe, kills the
Image of God, as it were in the eye. Many a Man lives
a burden to the Earth; but a goode Booke is the pretious
life-blood of a master spirit, inbalm’d and treasur’d up
on purpose to a Life beyond Life. ’T is true, no age
can restore a Life, whereof perhaps there is no great
losse; and revolutions of ages doe oft recover the losse
of a rejected Truth, for the want of which whole Nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span>
fare the worse. We should be wary therefore what persecution
we raise against the living labours of publick
men, how we spill that season’d Life of Man preserved
and stor’d up in Books; since we see a kinde of homicide
may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdome; and
if it extend to the whole impression, a kinde of massacre,
whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elementall
Life, but strikes at that ethereall and first essence,
the breath of Reason itselfe, slaies an Immortality rather
than a Life.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="center">THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF LITERARY
PROPERTY.</p></div>

<p class="noin dropcap">I HAVE endeavoured in the foregoing pages to describe
the varying conditions under which was carried
on, during the ten centuries succeeding the fall of
the Roman Empire, the production and distribution of
literature. The term “books” is, of course, not strictly
applicable to a large portion of the material produced by
the scribes during the manuscript period. As a matter
of convenience, I have used the phrase “production of
literature” to cover what should, speaking more precisely,
properly be described as the reproduction or multiplication
of literature. The labour of the scribes during
the manuscript period was given, as has been noted,
almost exclusively to the production of copies of the
more or less fragmentary texts that had been preserved
from the classic period, or from the writings of the
Church Fathers. The case was the same with the earlier
printers, whose undertakings were in like manner devoted
to old-time literature and with whom the production of a
work by a contemporary writer was a comparatively rare
exception. During these ten centuries, not a few writers
did noteworthy work, and some of the great books of the
world’s literature belong to this manuscript period.
Even, however, with books recognised later as famous,
the fame came but slowly, so that the requirement for
the multiplication of those for which demand arose became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[478]</span>
the task of scribes of the generations succeeding
that of the author, rather than of those of his own time.
An author like Pope Gregory I. with the vast machinery
of the Church at his disposal, was in a position to secure
for his writings an immediate distribution and during his
own lifetime, to trace the influence of their teachings.
Except, however, in such special cases, writers were
obliged to content themselves with such present measure
of appreciation as might be given by sympathetic readers
or hearers in their own monasteries, leaving such of their
productions as possessed any abiding vitality to gain
repute with future generations of monkish readers, as
copies slowly made their way from <i>scriptorium</i> to <i>scriptorium</i>.</p>

<p>During this long period in which the chief difficulty lay
in the distribution of books, and in which an author who
had anything to say to the world was only too happy if,
during his own lifetime, it might prove practicable to
reach with his books any number of men outside of his
own immediate circle, there could, of course, be no question
of property or copyright control in the literary production.
Such property as might be said to exist in
literature pertained solely to the material form, the manuscript
produced, which represented a certain value for
parchment and for labour.</p>

<p>After the time of Charlemagne, when there came to
be, in a few Court circles and in the homes of the more
active-minded noblemen following the fashion set by the
Court, an interest in the preservation of literature, we
find record of compensation paid to literary producers.
Such compensation came first, naturally, to the scribes,
who possessed sufficient learning and technical skill to
place before the communities in which they themselves
lived, the learning of the past. Later, with the beginning
of original writing in the form of chronicles, there
are instances of rewards or honours conferred upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span>
monkish chroniclers by the kings or princes whose ancestors
were glorified, or whose personal deeds were commemorated.
The rewards for literary labour, rewards
given, as said, almost exclusively to clerics, most frequently
took the form of ecclesiastical preferment. A
prebend or a bishopric cost little or nothing to the King,
while it meant for the author a very substantial compensation.
It is the clerical character of the author and the
ecclesiastical nature of his compensation which constitute
the principal distinction between the beginnings of
compensation for literary labour in the Middle Ages and
the arrangements under which were rewarded the poet-chroniclers
of the later classic times. The authors of the
earliest literature-producing periods sang, as it will be
remembered, under the incentive not of princely gifts,
but of popular appreciation.</p>

<p>The records of the Benedictine monasteries give evidence
of the production and accumulation of certain
property in the form of literature, property which increased
in available value as methods were developed for
exchanges between the different monasteries of the surplus
copies of their texts, and which assumed still more
importance when, with a gradually developing interest in
literature, wealthy laymen were occasionally prepared to
give in exchange for the precious manuscripts, lands, cattle,
moneys, or desirable privileges. With the development
in the respect for learning and letters which in
certain portions of Europe followed the establishment,
under the general direction of Alcuin, of the imperial
schools of Charlemagne, the influence and fame of the
monasteries came to be measured very largely by their
respective literary activity, the importance of the ancient
codices preserved in the <i>scriptoria</i>, and the beauty and
accuracy of these texts. A monastery, the collections
and the <i>scriptorium</i> of which had in this manner become
famous, would be visited by monastic scholars from distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span>
<i>parts who sought opportunity to examine, and possibly</i>
to copy, the precious texts, and it was this class of
institutions that would be resorted to by the higher class
of recluses, who, retiring from the world, enriched with
their fortunes the Benedictine foundations. The schools
of the literary monasteries would also be selected for the
training of the young princes and noblemen, from whom
in later years protection and endowments for their <i>almæ
matres</i> could often be depended upon. When learning
and literary activity served in these several ways to bring
to a monastery fame and fortune, it was natural for the
monks, whose service as scholars, instructors, and scribes
had proved most effective in the <i>scriptorium</i> and in the
schools, to be selected for honour and preferment, and
that the learned <i>armarius</i> or <i>librarius</i> should frequently
become the abbot, and should, later, find himself bishop
or archbishop, or even pope. The elevation to the papacy,
in 999, of Sylvester II., previously known as Gerbert,
Abbot of Bobbio, and as Bishop Gerbert, is an example of
such a progress from the <i>scriptorium</i> to the leadership of
the Church. I do not, of course, undertake to say that
either in Gerbert’s time or during any century of the
period in question, there was throughout the monasteries
and the ecclesiastical communities as a whole, any universal
respect for learning and for literary industry, and
that honours and preferment always followed in proportion
to the value of the scholarly service rendered. I
only point out, as has been stated in the chapters on the
monasteries, that even in the so-called “Dark Ages” of
Europe, the ages of which the year 1000 may perhaps
have been the centre, this was very much more largely
the case than is always remembered by historians of a
later period writing from a Protestant point of view,
some of whom, like D’Aubigné, have appeared to contend
that learning and literature had been buried during
the thousand years of Catholic rule, and had only been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[481]</span>
rediscovered by Luther and Calvin. The groundlessness
of this kind of contention has, I think, been made clear
in the brilliant dissertation on the Dark Ages by the Protestant
Maitland, while a mass of testimony in support of
Maitland’s views has been collected by Montalembert,
evidence the value of which may be weakened but cannot
be nullified by the wordy eloquence with which it is
presented.</p>

<p>I have spoken of certain monasteries becoming the
resort of literary pilgrims on account of their ownership
of some treasured manuscript handed down from an
earlier generation. When, as was frequently the case,
the production of copies of such a text was prohibited
altogether, or was permitted only to members of the monastery
itself, we have an example of a copyright control of
the earlier kind, a control resting upon the ownership not
of the text but of the parchment upon which the text had
been placed. If, for instance, a well authenticated copy of
Augustine’s <i>City of God</i> was held in the <i>scriptorium</i> of
Fulda, and another copy, perhaps equally famous, belonged
to that of St. Gall, each monastery could prohibit
the copying of its own parchment, and could in this manner
control the “copyright” of its own particular text.
It is to be borne in mind that no two manuscripts could
be in exact accord and that a particular character or
authority frequently attached to the text or version presented
in a particular parchment. Neither monastery
could, in the case imagined, assume any right to control
what the later English law termed the “copy” of S.
Augustine’s treatise, but each exercised what was in substance
a copyright at Common Law over the text inscribed
on its own particular parchment. In the chapter on S.
Columba, reference was made to the famous copyright
contention between Columba and the Abbot Finnian,
a case the date of which is given as 567, and which was
probably, therefore, the earliest copyright issue decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[482]</span>
in Europe. While the story itself is in all probability
merely one of the long series of legends which grew
up about the brilliant Irish saint, it may well have had
some historic foundation. The more important consideration,
is, however, in the fact that whether the story were
true or not as applied to S. Columba, it represented an
impression in the mind of the chronicler Adamnan, writing
not half a century after the death of the saint, concerning
the conception of property in a form of ideas or
of instruction, a property which, as made clear in the
story, was entirely apart from that inhering in the parchment
itself. The possibility of such a conception coming
into the mind of a writer of the seventh century, is certainly
noteworthy.</p>

<p>Such a copyright control, beginning usually in the form
of a prohibition, was developed, later, to some extent
into a property right and a source of income. When the
<i>armarii</i> or <i>librarii</i> came to realise, first, that other copies
of their precious texts were in existence, so that no one
monastery was in a position to monopolise this piece of
the literature or learning of a past generation; and when,
further, they came to understand that gain could be
secured for their monastery chest by conceding for pay
the privilege of making one or more copies of their codex,
the practice of selling such privilege became more and
more frequent. It was, in fact, in this manner that the
earlier manuscript-dealers who succeeded in establishing
a system for the production and distribution of books in
manuscript, secured the larger proportion of the texts
with which their own collections would begin, the texts
which formed what might be called the “copy” for their
workshops. Occasionally we read of an Aurispa or a
Vespasiano purchasing at a high price some famous and
well authenticated so-called original codex; that is to
say, a parchment the date of the production of which
went back some centuries. More frequently, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span>
it is a copying privilege which is paid for by the dealer,
whose copyist is permitted, under the strictest supervision,
to visit the <i>scriptorium</i> and to transcribe the
parchment sheets, which are taken from the carefully
guarded <i>armarium</i> and are closely watched or even sometimes
held by the jealous monks while the process of
transcribing goes on. Vespasiano sometimes secures
from the <i>librarius</i> of the monastery a signed certificate
to the effect that the “copy” produced for him is a complete
and accurate transcript. More frequently, however,
at this later time, during the century which preceded
printing, the <i>scriptoria</i> of the monasteries had been so
largely neglected that in many institutions in which
were to be found valuable manuscripts highly cherished
by their owners, there was no one in the fraternity who
was competent to give any judgment upon the accuracy
of the scribe’s transcript because there was no one who
was able to understand the purport of the manuscript
itself.</p>

<p>This demoralised condition of the monastery collections
and the apathy and ignorance on the part of the
monks controlling those collections, was in many of the
monastic centres still more marked during the half century
following the invention of printing, when the earlier
printers were largely dependent for their “copy” for
both the classics and the works of the Fathers, upon such
parchments as might still have been preserved in the
monastic foundations. In a number of instances, these
first printers were obliged, as had been the later manuscript-dealers,
to pay for the privilege of examining, collating,
and copying. They were, however, frequently
able to purchase from monks who no longer valued a
parchment even as a fetish, the so-called “original.”
For the printer, who had of necessity a larger responsibility
for the correctness of his text than rested upon the
old manuscript-dealer, the task of securing the “copy”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span>
for his compositors was not completed when he had
secured control of one manuscript. With not only a risk
but a certainty of errors in each parchment, it was necessary
to collate a number of parchments before the scholarly
printer could feel any assurance that the more pernicious
errors at least had been detected and eliminated. Henry
Estienne the first speaks, for instance, of using as the
basis for one printed text no less than twelve manuscripts.
The first copyright known to Europe of the
Middle Ages may therefore be considered as that which
inhered in the Common Law control of property in the
manuscript. It was a copyright which had, of course,
nothing whatever to do with the rights of an original producer
in the literary production.</p>

<p>Another form of literary property which did not represent
literary creation, came into existence when some
enterprising <i>armarius</i>, not having in his own collection
some much-wanted manuscript, would make the long
journey to Rome or to Florence from Fulda, from St.
Gall, from Fleury, or even from far-off Glastonbury, and
would there secure the needed authority himself to prepare
a transcript of some valued codex. His manuscript,
brought back to his own monastery, might remain for
years the only well authenticated copy of the text in
question existing in a large region. Such a manuscript
represented, of course, a considerable expenditure of
skilled labour, of fatiguing travel, and, occasionally, also
of money, an expenditure or an investment which entitled
the parchment to be considered as in some sense a property
creation, the result of labour. While, as a matter of
scholarly fellowship or of Christian brotherhood, the privilege
of reading and the far greater privilege of copying
such a manuscript, might frequently be extended to fellow
Benedictines, the practice of securing some consideration
for its use, and particularly for the privilege of
making a transcript, obtained not infrequently, and was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[485]</span>
under the circumstances, fully warranted. The control
of such a manuscript constituted a “copyright” of a
somewhat different nature from that previously referred
to, which was maintained in the case of some old-time
codex that had been inherited or purchased in its original
form, and that did not represent any labour on the part
of the individual or the community claiming the ownership.</p>

<p>When the first printers began their work, they were of
necessity confronted with practically the same conditions
and difficulties in connection with the securing of “copy,”
as those with which the large manuscript-dealers had had
to contend. Their task was, in fact, as already indicated,
a more difficult one than that of the manuscript-dealers,
because the standard for completeness and correctness of
text had become more exacting. The parchments
required for their work were, with hardly an exception,
the property of monasteries, and whether for purchase,
for comparison, or for “copy,” the printers were usually
obliged to make substantial compensation for right to
copy. This right to copy might be described as a copyright
under limitations. The monastery which had
received compensation from a printer from Venice for the
use of a particular parchment, felt itself under no obligation
to decline a similar application from the rival printer
of Lyons, or of Basel. The printers were thus estopped
from securing any control over the works of the particular
author which they proposed to present to the readers of
their generation. They were even unable to secure any
exclusive right to the use of any particular text of such
author, unless, indeed, they had found means to purchase
the manuscript outright. A property control of some
kind was essential in order to justify the expenditure and
the labour required to bring the manuscript into print,
and this was finally arrived at, although inadequately
enough, under the system of privileges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[486]</span></p>

<p>While the first printing of books was done in Germany,
and while the number of books produced in Germany
during the half century after Gutenberg was much
greater than in any other country, the beginning of copyright
protection for printed books is to be credited to
Italy. Gutenberg, Fust, and their immediate successors
in Frankfort, Nuremberg, Basel, and Cologne, entered
upon their first publishing undertakings without the aid
of any government protection or recognition, municipal,
state, or imperial. In the chapter on the early printers
of Venice, I have described with some detail the system
of privileges, a system which, originating in Venice, was
adopted in the other Italian States, and which was followed
in substance by the other States of Europe. The
privileges of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were
the precursor and the foundation of the later system of
copyright.</p>

<p>The privileges granted by the Venetian Government
were, as we have seen, of four kinds. The first was in
the shape of a sweeping monopoly, under which the beneficiary
was granted for a term of years the exclusive right
to carry on the business of printing in Venice. Of this
class there is but one example, dating from 1469, the
details of which are given in the chapter on Italy. The
second kind, a little less sweeping, gave to the beneficiary
a monopoly for the production of all books of a given
class, or in a particular language. The first example of
this was the privilege granted, in 1495, to Aldus for the
exclusive printing of books in Greek. Under the same
division may be classed the privilege given a year or two
later, also to Aldus, for the exclusive use of the italic
type, a form which was the invention of Aldus. These
two divisions of privileges have, of course, no logical connection
with copyright. The last named is rather of the
character of a patent, while the first two may properly be
classed with commercial monopolies. There is this distinction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[487]</span>
however, that while commercial monopolies
have, as a rule, been granted for the purpose of enriching
some favourite of the Crown, or have in some manner
represented jobbery at the expense of the people, the
legislators who granted the first printing privileges had
unquestionably honestly convinced themselves that in no
other way could the new art, the importance of which
they were prepared to appreciate, be effectively encouraged
and established. It was doubtless the case also that
Aldus, in incurring expenditure in making Greek type
and in printing Greek books, was assuming very serious
and speculative risks, and was fairly entitled to all the
encouragement which the State could give to him.</p>

<p>The third class of privilege was that securing for an
editor or publisher a monopoly for the production of the
works of some author of a past generation, usually, in
fact, for an author of classic times. This is the form of
privilege which, for two centuries succeeding printing,
is most frequently met with, and which constituted the
foundation on which the publishers of those two centuries
carried on their business. The general purpose is
the same as that of the general privileges previously
specified, namely, to give to a printer-publisher an encouragement
or inducement to enter upon an expensive
and speculative undertaking which, without such special
aid, might, from a commercial point of view, have appeared
impracticable. When Aldus desired to undertake
the production of the first printed edition of the works of
<i>Aristotle</i>, the difficult and venturesome undertaking was
made a little less venturesome by the action of the Senate
of Venice in prohibiting for a term of ten years the printing
of any other editions of <i>Aristotle</i>. It is to be borne
in mind that such a privilege, while sweeping in character,
was very limited as to territory. There was nothing in
law to prevent the printing in Milan of the rival edition
of the <i>Aristotle</i> which was prohibited in Venice, nor even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span>
the use for such rival work of text and the editorial material
appropriated from the volumes of Aldus. The protection
given (still within narrow territorial limits) to such
collated texts and original notes and introductions, belongs
in essence under the fourth class of privilege, the
class in which we find the first recognition of the principle
of copyright in a literary production for the sake of the
producer or of his assigns. The earliest European example
of the third class of privilege, which may be described
as a publisher’s copyright, bears date 1492, and was issued
by the Venetian Senate to Bernardino de Benaliis.</p>

<p>The fourth class of privilege was that securing to an
author the copyright of his own production. Such a
privilege differed from modern copyright only in being
usually conditional upon or being the result of the action
of censors by whom it had to be “approved and privileged,”
and on the ground of the narrow limits of term
and of territory. It constituted or recognised a property
right, but an extremely restricted right, and a very small
property. It is certainly curious that (with the exception
of the printing monopoly of 1469, which was a privilege
only in name) the earliest privilege of which there is record
in Italy or in Europe, was one issued to an author
for his own production, and which constituted, therefore,
a copyright in the modern sense of the term. This privilege
was issued as early as 1486, by the Senate of Venice,
to Antonio Sabellico, for his <i>Decades Rerum Venetiarum</i>.
No term was specified, and the copyright might, therefore,
be considered as indefinite or perpetual. The second
Venetian privilege, also without term, was that issued in
1492, to Peter of Ravenna, for his <i>Phœnix</i>. This has
been referred to by Pütter and by other good authorities,
as the first copyright privilege issued in Europe. The
discovery of the earlier privilege of Sabellico, is due to
Horatio Brown. The third privilege, dating from 1493,
and also issued in Venice, constituted a very definite recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span>
of the existence of literary property, in that it
gave to a certain Daniele Barbaro, who had inherited from
his deceased brother, Hermolao Barbaro, the manuscript
of the work, the control for a term of ten years in the
<i>Castigationes Plinii</i>. After this time, the instances of
privileges to authors are very few and far between. It is
the rule to find them issued to printer-publishers, and
except in so far as they covered original editorial labour
put into the work by the publishers, these privileges
should be described rather as trade monopolies (for very
restricted territories), than as copyrights.</p>

<p>While the more enterprising of the printers of Venice,
Milan, Rome, and other cities, were, as described, occasionally
able to secure privileges also in other Italian
States, these privileges did not give any safe assurance of
a proportionately extended market. In time of war, all
such interstate arrangements lapsed, while even in the
times of peace, it was very difficult and often impracticable
to secure in any “foreign” territory the enforcement
of the protection granted, or the collection of penalties
prescribed. Such foreign privileges could, as a rule, be
considered rather as a permit or licence to sell the original
edition than as an undertaking on the part of a foreign
government to prevent the sale of an unauthorised edition.
The range of these privileges was, as noted, restricted
in territory as well as limited in effectiveness.
During the century succeeding printing, it was very seldom
indeed that the attempt was made to secure a privilege
for an Italian publication for any territory outside of
Italy, or for a French publication outside of France, or
for a German work outside of Germany. An exception to
this limitation was, however, afforded by what were
known as papal privileges which, in form at least, conceded
to the printers to whom they were issued exclusive
control not only within the States of the Church but for
all the States of the world that acknowledged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[490]</span>
authority of the Church. There was, however, practically
no machinery for enforcing the authority of the
papal privileges. They gave to the book and to its
publisher a certain precedence and advantage with the
faithful followers of the Church over editions of the same
work which had not the sanction of the papal privilege.
I can, however, find record of no instances in
which a publisher, whose papal privilege had been infringed,
had found it possible to enjoin the publication of
a rival edition also offered for sale in Catholic States.
The material advantage of a papal privilege was that it
carried with it the assurance of the approval of the Church
concerning the character of the book. It constituted,
namely, evidence that the book had secured the approval
of the Church bureau of censorship, and (with an occasional
exception) it preserved it from interference on the
part of local ecclesiastical censors, whose prejudices were
usually more bitter and whose ignorant dread of heretical
scholarship was greater, than was the case with the censors
associated directly with S. Peter’s.</p>

<p>It was the case with the local as well as with the papal
privileges that the protection and encouragement of the
author was only a part, and not infrequently the smaller
part, of their purpose. It was considered essential by the
State no less than by the Church to retain an effective
supervision and control over the productions of the Press.
Before the privilege could be secured, the work must be
submitted to the censors and a favourable report must
have been given. The privilege was, therefore, in itself
evidence that the work protected by it contained no
material considered dangerous by the political or the
ecclesiastical authorities of the State. To secure the
benefit of even such small measure of property protection
as that given under the local privilege for five or
ten years, it was, as a rule, necessary that the work
should be practically non-committal in character, at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[491]</span>
as far as political or theological opinions were concerned.</p>

<p>The history of the Italian publishers shows what a
serious burden was from the outset placed upon the production
of literature in the peninsula, and how disastrous
the effect was upon publishing enterprise and publishing
development, by the establishment of machinery for
political and ecclesiastical censorship, and by the necessity
of awaiting the approval of these censors before
carrying to completion publishing undertakings. In
Italy, the trouble was in the main with the Church, and,
as a rule, with the authorities at Rome rather than with
the local ecclesiastics. In many of the cities, the local
representatives of the Church to whom was confided the
first censorship responsibility, were interested in and
sympathised with the spirit of local independence, while
they also were in a position to realise somewhat the
difficulties caused to the new business of printing and
publishing by too strenuous an exercise of censorship
authority. This state of things was particularly true in
Venice, where, as we have seen, the municipal feeling
was very strong, and where educated monks like Paolo
Sarpi were ready themselves to act as leaders in the contest
to defend against the aggression of the Church what
was, practically, the existence of the Press.</p>

<p>In France, where the operations of the Press were,
during the first half century of printing, much less important
than in Italy, the first privilege was issued in
1503. The official censorship of publications began in
1515, with the accession of Francis I. There are instances
during the reign of Louis XII. of certain “permits”
or “approvals” being placed upon books, but
these were not the result of examination by official censors,
and do not appear to have been connected with any
restrictions imposed upon the publishers. The Theological
Faculty of the Sorbonne succeeded, as has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[492]</span>
noted in the record of the Estiennes, in keeping up an
active and fairly continuous supervision of, and interference
with, the publication of Bibles and of other books
claimed to belong to the department of theology. The
University claimed the right to supervise and control
printing, on the ground that the printers and publishers
were the successors of the old-time University scribes,
the <i>stationarii</i> and <i>librarii</i>, and were members of the
University, and that the printing-press was to be considered
as part of the machinery of higher education. There
was certainly good foundation for this claim, but, as it
proved, the University was not sufficiently strong to
maintain its contention.</p>

<p>The importance of this new machinery for influencing
public opinion was speedily recognised by the Crown,
and as the power of the monarch was increased through
the consolidation of the kingdom, the kings succeeded in
securing the practical control over the business of printing
and selling books. While it was the case, as has been
noted in the history of Robert Estienne, that the influence
of Francis I. was, on the whole, exercised to defend
the Press against the oppression of the theologians, the
authority of Henry II. and of his successors was, as a
rule, exercised against the more liberal policy of the University
and in favour of a very close and frequently
unduly burdensome supervision of publishing undertakings.
After the accession of Henry II. the regulations
concerning the Press, or at least that portion of the Press
regulations which were of essential importance, emanate
from the Crown. It is the royal chancellor, or his representative,
who decides what books shall receive the
official permit, and what the term of privilege is to be.
This term, beginning in the reign of Francis with five
years, was gradually extended until, with the routine renewal,
the average length by the reign of Henry IV. was
twenty years. The main feature in the history of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[493]</span>
Press in France is the authority and the interference of the
Crown, as in Italy it had been the exacting censorship of
the Church.</p>

<p>In Germany, the earlier printer-publishers found themselves,
at least up to the time of the Reformation, comparatively
free from the interference of the Church. For
the sixty-eight years between the date of Gutenberg’s
printing-press and that of the Diet of Augsburg, the
printer-publishers were left free to print Bibles, editions
of the Fathers with new notes and commentaries, and
such contemporary writings as were found available (the
list of these last being in any case but inconsiderable),
without interference from censors of the Church and
without any attempt at supervision or control on the
part of municipal, state, or imperial authorities. The
immediate and active use of the printing-press made by
the Lutherans brought about some change in this situation;
a system of censorship was at once established by
the Church, and its authority was confirmed by the Emperor.
A sweeping prohibition was issued not only
against all Lutheran writings, but against all books, theological
or other, emanating from Protestants. In some
of the cities which were most faithful to the Catholic
cause, these imperial-ecclesiastical edicts were confirmed
by the municipalities and attempts were made to enforce
their provisions upon the printing-presses and the bookshops
within the municipal territories. A few years later,
as in North Germany the cause of the Protestants organised
and strengthened itself, the rulers of certain Protestant
States undertook, at the instance of Luther and
his associates, to establish censorship from a Protestant,
or rather from a Lutheran standpoint. The printing and
the sale of Romanist books on the one hand, and of Anabaptist
and Zwinglian heresies on the other, were prohibited,
and the printing of any books was permitted only
after the approval of the official censors had been given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[494]</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, this long series of prohibitions,
censorships, and supervisory edicts, imperial,
state, and municipal, the work of the German printer-publishers
was interfered with to a comparatively small
extent. The issuing of edicts, regulations, and proclamations,
satisfied the official conscience and met the
immediate requirements of the authorities of Rome on the
one hand, and of the militant Protestants on the other.</p>

<p>They amounted, however, as far as the restriction of
the Press was concerned, to very little more than waste
paper. The machinery for their enforcement was never
adequate, and the continued personal interest in carrying
out regulations and in enforcing penalties which interfered
with so important a German industry as that of printing,
appears never to have been keen. The political supervision
or censorship was no more effective or consistent
than the ecclesiastical. From time to time some book
would be prohibited because it contained material disrespectful
or antagonistic to emperor, prince, or duke; but
the book prohibited in Augsburg could easily be printed
in Nuremberg, and the work interfered with in Leipzig
found prompt distribution from Wittenberg. Germany
was too manifold, and the centres of intellectual activity
and of publishing enterprise were too numerous, to make
it practicable to carry out for the whole realm any general
censorship supervision or restriction. The attempt might
be compared to the experiment of blocking up in a volcanic
region one or two of the more active vents, with
the certainty that the exploding forces would immediately
find new outlets. Individual undertakings might be interfered
with, but it was impossible to block the operations
of the printing-presses of Germany. In this respect
the printer-publishers of Germany had a material advantage
over those of Paris, whose operations were subjected
to the supervision and to the authority (or rather, to the
conflicting authorities) of the University (and particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[495]</span>
of the Theological Faculty of the Sorbonne), of the Parliament
of Paris, and of the Crown.</p>

<p>The division of their territory and the lack of central
authority placed the Germans, however, under serious
disadvantages in other ways. While, in France, a royal
privilege covered the territory of the entire kingdom,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> the
German privilege was issued for a principality, an electorate,
a duchy, or a city. The book protected for Electoral
Saxony, was open to appropriation in Prussia or the
Palatinate, or, indeed, in the adjoining Duchy of Saxony.
It was also the case that the German publishers were
powerless to protect themselves against the piratical competition
of Basel and Geneva on the one hand, and of
Antwerp and Amsterdam on the other. I do not forget
that, in addition to the local privileges, imperial privileges
were from time to time secured from the Chancellor
at Vienna, which, in form at least, protected a book
throughout the entire realm of “the Holy Roman Empire,”
but authorities like Pütter and Kapp are at one in
the conclusion that these privileges were entirely disregarded
by the reprinters and gave practically no property
protection for literary productions. An exception to this
should be made for the imperial cities (<i>Reichsstädte</i>), in
which an imperial privilege did carry with it some authority.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>In fact, it occasionally happened that the reprinters
who planned to invade with an unauthorised edition the
markets of Frankfort or Nuremberg, were able to secure
an imperial privilege, and by means of this to give some
legal colour to their undertaking. The difficulty was
not that the imperial Chancellor desired to interfere with
legitimate publishing undertakings, but that it was considered
desirable to emphasise the control of the imperial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[496]</span>authority over the work of the printing-press, and the
contention was not infrequently maintained in Vienna
that no books should be placed in the market without the
approval and the permit of the Emperor. It was further
the case that no trustworthy registry appears to have
been preserved in Vienna during the first century of
printing, so that it was quite possible for duplicate privileges
to be issued to competing printers for the same book
and for the same term. No attempt was made to keep a
record in Vienna of the privileges issued in the different
German States, and as a result there was, of course, nothing
to prevent conflicting claims of ownership concerning
a literary production, and conflicts between the imperial
and local authorities as to their respective powers in the
business. The lack of any system for the interchange of
copyright entries, and the incompleteness and lack of
accuracy of the registers of any one State was also the
cause of frequent conflicts and difficulties between the
publishers of different cities, difficulties which usually
came to a head when the competing editions, each duly
privileged by some authority, came to be offered for sale
at the semi-annual Fair.</p>

<p>With this utter confusion as to the law of copyright (if
such a term as law can properly be applied to this medley
of conflicting regulations), and with no central authority
to apply to from which any adequate help could be
secured, the printer-publishers of Germany were obliged
to take the matter into their own hands. No agreements
or regulations that they might frame could serve to protect
their books against the unauthorised competition of
Lyons, Basel, Antwerp, or Amsterdam. They were even
not in a position to enforce enactments against the piratically
inclined members of the trade within the territory
of Germany. They could, however, frame such a compact
as should guide the business policy and practice
of the leading members of their own fraternity, while it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[497]</span>
also proved possible, through the influence of the business
pressure that these leading publishers were in a
position to bring to bear, to compel the majority of
the printers and traders to respect and conform to the
regulations decided upon by the organisation of the whole
trade. The fact that the German book-trade was the
first in Europe to bring about an effective organisation
of its own business, an organisation which, with the
modifications and developments called for by the changing
conditions of trade, is in 1896 still more complete,
comprehensive, and effective than it was in 1503, was
doubtless largely due to the peculiar disadvantages under
which the work of the German printer-publishers had been
begun. If there was to be in Germany any property in
literary production, if there was to be any assured return
for literary labour and for publishing risk and outlay, it
was necessary that some authority should be constituted
which should act for the entire German realm and which
should make up for the absence in that realm of any
uniform or consistent system of law. This authority was
constituted, and this requirement was met by the organisation
of the German book-trade. This organisation was
by no means strong enough altogether to prevent unauthorised
reprinting. Such reprinting went on in various
parts of Germany until the close of the eighteenth century,
and caused no little friction, irritation, and contention
between the different book-making centres; and to
the extent to which it prevailed, it lessened also, of necessity,
the prospect of profitable returns from publishing
ventures, and lessened also the amount of the remuneration
that it was possible to secure for authors and for editors
for their contribution to such undertakings. When,
however, the leading publishers throughout the empire
had arrived at an agreement to respect each other’s publishing
undertakings, the seriousness of unauthorised competition
and the risk of the appropriation by reprinters of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[498]</span>
texts the cost of the reproduction of which had been borne
by others, were very much lessened. It proved also practicable
through the machinery of the Guild, which originated
with the Frankfort Fair and which was brought to
its final organisation in Leipzig, to bring pressure to bear
upon such of the publishers, printers, and booksellers as
had in the first place not been disposed to accept the
regulations of the Guild. When it was made impracticable
to sell at the book-fairs or through the central channels
of distribution in Frankfort or in Leipzig, editions
which had been classed as “unauthorised” or “piratical,”
the possibility of securing profit in the production
of such editions was very much diminished, so that their
number decreased from year to year.</p>

<p>This satisfactory result, to be sure, belongs to a later
period than that considered in the present study. No such
final organisation of the book-trade had been completed
or perfected before the beginning of the eighteenth century,
but in the institution of the Fair at Frankfort and
in regulations and arrangements arrived at between the
leading printer-publishers who twice a year came together
at this Fair, the later organisation was foreshadowed and
the preliminary steps towards it were taken.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of the Thirty Years’ War was, of
necessity, to undermine and almost put a stop to literary
production and publishing undertakings in Germany.
Cities like Magdeburg, Wittenberg, Leipzig, Münster,
and others where the production of books by the Protestant
leaders had been active, found themselves the centres
of the campaigns between the Swedes and the Imperialists.
Frankfort, which, in certain respects, suffered much
less directly from the operations of war, was, during considerable
portions of the time, so far isolated by the contesting
armies, that its connection with the usual channels
of book distribution could not be kept open. When the
means of transportation were still available and the publishers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[499]</span>
were able to reach Frankfort with their samples,
the booksellers were so far discouraged as to the prospect
of making sales in their home towns that many of them
did not think the journey to Frankfort worth the risk and
the outlay. During the whole thirty years of the war,
the Fair was continued, at least in form, but in not a few
of those years it was merely a form.</p>

<p>As one result, therefore, of the deplorable condition of
Germany, the printer-publishers of Holland secured a
much larger proportion of the book-trade of Europe.
Amsterdam, Leyden, and Utrecht were all outside of the
campaigning operations and were also favourably situated
for reaching the markets of Europe. In addition to these
favourable political and physical conditions, the Dutch
printers had made very noteworthy advances in the art of
typography, and the Dutch and Belgian illustrators had
from the beginning done much better work than was as
yet known in Germany. The high standard of the scholarship
of the Universities of Leyden and of Amsterdam,
the fact that Holland was, during the first half of the
seventeenth century, outside of the contests that were
absorbing many of the European States, and the further
fact that the Protestant Republic had freed itself altogether
from the trammels of the censorship of Rome and
had refused to replace these with the equally burdensome
censorship of Geneva, had the effect of attracting to Holland
scholarly thinkers and writers from various parts of
Europe.</p>

<p>With scholarly writers and material thus provided, with
the most fully developed typographical facilities that
Europe had as yet known, and with the widest possible
commercial connections, the printer-publishers of Holland
had at their command during the larger portion of this
century, all the factors requisite for the building up of
great publishing interests. They utilised these facilities
to good purpose, and by the close of the Thirty Years’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[500]</span>
War they had definitely taken from Italy, France, and
Germany the leadership in the enterprise, importance,
and high standard of their publishing undertakings.</p>

<p>The chapter on the Elzevirs, who can be accepted as
types of the publishers of Holland during this period of
the supremacy of Dutch publishing, will have shown that
the Republic did not during this period make any important
contributions to, or precedents for, any system for
the protection of literary property. The territory of the
Republic was limited and the number of cities in which
important books were produced were but few. While
there does not seem to have been any formal compact,
the leading publishers had, however, evidently arrived at
some understanding between themselves to respect each
other’s undertakings. Privileges were secured from the
governments of the individual States, or sometimes from
the central authority of the Republic, but there was evidently
no uniformity of system in regard to these and
they do not appear to have been depended upon to any
material extent for the protection of the books. The
purpose in securing them seems to have been rather to
give evidence that the undertaking had received the sanction
or approval of the representatives selected by the
States for the purpose, representatives who were usually
scholars from the universities.</p>

<p>I have not been able to examine in detail the records
of the Dutch publishers of the period; but I have not
found in the history of the Elzevirs, whose undertakings
were more considerable for a time than those of all their
contemporaries together, any reference to the enforcement
of a Dutch privilege against a Dutch reprinter charged
with the infringement of the same. The records of the
Elzevirs give, however, very considerable evidence concerning
the extent to which the Dutch publishers appropriated,
according to their own convenience, the
undertakings of their competitors in Germany, Italy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[501]</span>
France. Of these appropriators, the Elzevirs were, as
pointed out, the chief offenders, and they were, during
the larger portion of the period in question, the only
Dutch publishers who were in a position through their
widespread connections to reach with their unauthorised
reprints the markets of the world. To the extent to
which they made sales outside of Holland, the value of
the property rights of the original publishers of Nuremberg,
Basel, Venice, or Paris, was diminished.</p>

<p>While the Elzevirs had, therefore, to an extent previously
unknown in the history of publishing, made of
piracy a fine art and a pursuit of world-wide commercial
importance, it seems probable, as before suggested, that,
in giving tangible evidence that literary distribution could
not be limited by political boundaries, and that literary
producers were addressing themselves to the readers, not
of their own State, smaller or greater, but of the civilised
world, they were preparing the way for a European recognition
of the nature of literary production and of the
equity and necessity of protecting literary producers.
The Elzevirs were able in this manner to render an important
service in preparing Europe for the system
of European copyright which was to take the place of
limited local privileges and state enactments.</p>

<p>One circumstance in connection with literary work and
book-production of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
furthered very largely the facility for unauthorised
competition and the work of piratical reprinters. This
was the fact that, as far as literature and learning were
concerned, there was but one language for Europe. In
the Universities, in the workroom of the scholar, in the
composing-room of the printing-office, we find that, for
nineteen-twentieths of the books that were being put
into shape, the text was Latin. The universality of the
language in which literature was preserved and learning
was maintained, a universality that was the essential characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[502]</span>
of the manuscript period and of the work of the
earlier universities during the same period, was in large
part maintained during the first two centuries of printing.
In the department of theology, to which belong probably
the larger proportion of the books of the earlier publishers,
all the works were in Latin. The division next in
importance, and possibly even greater in extent, comprised
the series of reproductions of the texts of the
authors of classic times. For these authors, both Latin
and Greek, the notes and the commentaries were, as a
rule, given in Latin. The works in jurisprudence, works
which were in the main expositions of the old Roman
law, were, with hardly an exception, printed in Latin
text, and the same was the case with works of medicine
and natural science.</p>

<p>The fact that in all the great universities of Europe,
during these same two centuries, the larger proportion of
the lectures in these several departments were given in
Latin, served, of course, to maintain and to extend this
universality of learning, of literature, and of science, and
to build up a body of scholars who belonged not to any
one State, least of all possibly to the “country of origin,”
but to Europe as a whole, to the world of literature and
of learning. The detail of smallest importance that occurs
in thinking of the career of a Casaubon, a Scaliger, or an
Erasmus, is the place of his birth. Even the places
selected by such a scholar for a sojourn of greater or less
length, are of much smaller moment in fixing his place or
his influence in the history of his generation or of the
world, than the particular school of thought with which
he associated himself, or the special undertakings to which
he gave his coöperation. It is interesting to note, particularly
in connection with the many difficulties in the way
of transportation, how largely the scholars of that day
lived in their correspondence. Men like Scaliger and
Erasmus, sojourning at times in isolated towns and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[503]</span>
but a small immediate circle, impressed themselves on the
thought of Europe through their letters to their friends.
The chapter on Erasmus emphasises the fact that, apart
even from the chief divisions of university work under
which the publications of the times were classified, a
writer of the sixteenth century who had a work of literature,
and even of light literature, to present to the world,
was able through the use of Latin to reach at once all the
cultivated communities. Such books as the <i>Praise of
Folly</i> and the <i>Colloquies</i> of Erasmus, or the <i>Ship of Fools</i>
of Brandt, became, within a wonderfully short time after
their publication, the talk of society in all circles and in all
cities of Europe. I do not overlook the fact that during
the latter part of the period now in question, there came
to be an increasing proportion of printing in the vernacular.
From the beginning of printing in the Low Countries,
popular romances and legends had been issued in
French, and the same practice was followed by the printers
of Lyons, who gave special attention to what we
should call popular publishing. Various translations
appeared shortly after the publication of the Latin originals
of the <i>Praise of Folly</i> and of <i>The Ship of Fools</i>.
Works like those of Luther, while issued originally, or
at least simultaneously, in Latin, for the purpose of influencing
the opinion of the scholars of Europe and of his
own monastic associates, were put almost at once into
German, because their special purpose was to make clear
to Luther’s own community, and to the less educated
portion of such community, the truths that seemed to
him essential, concerning the relations of man to his
Creator and concerning the usurpation of the Roman
Church, which had undertaken to control those relations.
These exceptions do not, however, militate against the
substantial accuracy of the general statement that Latin
as the language of literature was the language of the
printing-office and of publishing undertakings as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[504]</span></p>

<p>It seems to me probable that if the practice had continued
of retaining one literary language for Europe, the
possibility of securing one system for controlling and protecting
literary production throughout Europe would
have been very much furthered, and the date of interstate
European copyright might have been advanced by a century
or more. There seemed at one time to be a possibility
that with the decline of the general use of Latin,
the language of France would be accepted by the writers
of Europe as a convenient form for literature which was
international in its character and which was addressed to
the whole civilised world. Such general or international
use of French proved, however, but a passing phase or
episode in literary history, a phase which probably saw
its culmination during the reign of Frederic the Great.
The revival of the feeling of nationality which accompanied
or resulted from the completion of the organisation
of the great States of Europe, brought with it a revival
of patriotic interest in the maintenance of the national
language for the literature of the nation. As a result, we
find a revival, or rather a development, of German; the
writers of Italy bringing their books before the world no
longer in Latin but in Italian, those of England accepting
for their medium their home language, and those of
France finding the use of the literary language which they
had hoped to see adopted by Europe as a whole, restricted
to French territory and to one or two adjoining
States. It is only in countries like Belgium and Switzerland
which possess no national tongue, or like Holland,
the home language of which has too limited a circle of
readers, or like Russia, whose language lies outside of
literary civilisation, that we find any continuity in the
practice of bringing books into print in French, or occasionally
in Latin.</p>

<p>With this development of national literature, written in
the tongue of the country of origin, and the direct availability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[505]</span>
of which is in the main limited to the readers of
such country, there comes, for a time at least, a retrogression
in the tendency which had been gaining strength,
to consider Europe, as far as its literature was concerned,
as one community. The domestic laws for the protection
of literary property begin to take shape, and to secure
for such property within the limits of the State in
which it originated a better assured and a more lasting
protection. At the same time, however, that these domestic
copyright laws are being enacted, we find an increase
in the impression that the authors outside of the State
have no rights calling for consideration and that the
interests of the home publishers and of the home readers
call for and justify the largest measure of appropriation
that seems convenient of the productions of these foreign
authors in the form of translations.</p>

<p>The development of public opinion to such condition
of enlightenment as assured the recognition of literary
production as property, irrespective of political boundaries
and irrespective also of the particular form of language in
which it might appear in print, came but slowly. This
education and development on the part of the community
on the one hand, and on that of authors and their
publishers on the other, belong, of course, to a later
period than that here under consideration. It was not, in
fact, until the time of the discussions in England which
resulted from the famous statute of 1710 (discussions
which began in 1769 in connection with the suit of Millar
<i>vs.</i> Taylor) that we find any intelligent consideration given
to the principles involved and to the interests at stake in
the definition and the protection of literary property.
The first general discussion in France concerning the
rights of literary producers and their relations to the community,
was due to the Convention of 1793.</p>

<p>In Germany, as before indicated, the feebleness of the
imperial authority and the lack of any real unity or harmony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[506]</span>
of imperial action, had the result of throwing the
consideration of such a matter as copyright back upon the
local legislatures of the State. As a consequence, the
framing of any consistent legislation, giving such recognition
to literary property as had been secured under the
monarchy in England and the revolutionary republic in
France, was delayed in Germany until 1837, when the
Act was passed in Prussia which formed the model for
the similar Acts passed shortly thereafter by the legislatures
of a number of the other States of the empire.</p>

<p>If Germany was, in connection with the special difficulties
attending the delay in its reorganisation as a nation,
somewhat slow in the recognition given to the principles
of copyright, this delay has, as far as the interest of
literary producers and of copyright owners are concerned,
been more than offset by the admirable service
rendered through the organisation, already referred to, of
the German book-trade. To Germany also belongs the
credit of inaugurating the system of interstate copyright
that gave the precedents for the international copyright
conventions, and that served as the suggestion and the
precursor of the European system of recognition and
protection of literary property instituted in 1887 by the
Convention of Berne.</p>

<p>It was France, however, that took the initiative in
calling this Convention, and it was the members of the
Association of French Authors and Artists who had the
larger share of the responsibility for planning the policy
and shaping the work of the Convention. The result of
these public-spirited labours has been to secure, for the
first time in history, an assured recognition and protection
for literary and artistic property.</p>

<p>It is evident from this brief summary that, by the close
of the seventeenth century, the term fixed for the completion
of the present study, the conception of literary
property had not reached any very advanced stage of
development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[507]</span></p>

<p>The diverse theories which came into discussion in the
latter part of the eighteenth century, in England in 1769
and 1774, in France in 1793, and in Germany somewhat
later, may be briefly summarised as follows:</p>

<p>1st. Property in an intellectual conception or creation
is fully analogous to property in a material creation, and
implies as comprehensive and unlimited a control for the
production of the labour of the mind as that conceded
by the community to the production of the labour of
the hand.</p>

<p>2d. Intellectual property depends upon an individual
agreement or convention to which each person enjoying
the use of a copy of a literary (or artistic) production
makes himself a party.</p>

<p>3d. Property in an intellectual production depends
upon the natural or personal rights of the author, who
through unauthorised appropriations, would be caused an
injury or tort.</p>

<p>4th. Property in an intellectual production is the creation
of statute, and is subject to limitations depending
not upon any natural rights of the producer, but upon the
convenience or advantage of the community.</p>

<p>Of these several theories or conceptions, it is the fourth
which represents in substance the survival of the discussions
of two centuries, and which has formed the basis of
the copyright legislation of both Europe and America.</p>

<p>It is probably not yet practicable to determine whether
such survival represents the survival of the fittest. I am
inclined to think that the actual status of an intellectual
production and the relation of its producer to the community
would be more accurately expressed by a combination
of the first and fourth of these theories. We may
assume in the first place that the right of the producer to
the complete and unrestricted control of an intellectual
production has been accepted as no less binding upon
the community than the rights of the producers of material
property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[508]</span></p>

<p>Secondly, we may admit that an intellectual production
is from its special character much more exposed to appropriation
or invasion than is material property, and that an
adequate protection of the property-rights of a literary
producer can be secured only by means of a very considerable
measure of special legislation, and that even this
legislation would often prove inadequate for the purpose
unless it were seconded or supported by public opinion
and by the good will of the community.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we may assume that as a consideration for this
service of exceptional legislation and for this special coöperation
of the community in aiding in the protection of
his very “difficult” property, the creator of an intellectual
production is willing to sacrifice in favour of the
community a portion of his unrestricted ownership.</p>

<p>An application of such an hypothesis of a practical
adjustment of the rights and requirements of the author
on the one hand and the interests of the community on the
other, is afforded by the record of copyright legislation
in France. The long series of discussions, which, beginning
in 1793, were continued until 1867, resulted in the
conclusion that the claim of the author to a copyright in
perpetuity could in theory not be refuted. The legislation
with which these discussions were terminated, did not,
however, carry this conclusion to its logical result. The
term of copyright was fixed not for perpetuity but for
the life of the author and fifty years thereafter. The
author’s property-right in his creations was, namely,
protected for himself, for his children, and for his grandchildren,
but after these natural family interests had been
provided for, consideration was given to the interests of
the community at large, and the literary production was
taken into the public domain.</p>

<p>There has been, I contend, in this copyright arrangement
arrived at in France, something in the nature of
a compact between the author and the State, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[509]</span>
I do not find such a view presented in the discussions
of the time. It seems to me that such a compact is
not only equitable but logical,—and that it secures a
satisfactory solution for the vexed question concerning
copyright in perpetuity. The author asks for a larger
measure of protective service from the State than that
required by the owner of property like a house (or, for
that matter, of any other class of property), and he is
willing in return for such special service, if the results
of his labours may, by adequate legislation, be assured
for his immediate descendants, to surrender to the community
the property-right in perpetuity which under his
inherent right and at common law was as fully vested
in him as is the title of a house in the man who has
produced it.</p>

<p>The consideration of these several theories or conceptions
does not properly belong to the history of literary
production prior to the beginning of the eighteenth century.
I make reference to them here simply because they
represent the conclusions toward which were gradually
developed the more limited conceptions arrived at in the
earlier centuries, the centuries whose literary activities
and conditions I have attempted in these volumes to
describe.</p>
